Israeli forces have intensified their ground and air campaign on Gaza in recent days, with officials claiming to have reached “the heart” of the besieged enclave’s main city. This comes as Israel has agreed to daily pauses of military operations in parts of northern Gaza, the White House said, allowing people to travel for aid and relief. On Thursday alone, around 80,000 people fled northern Gaza through an evacuation corridor, an Israeli official said, compared with 50,000 people Wednesday. While CNN cannot independently verify the figures, images on the ground show streams of people — men, women, children, the elderly and disabled — traveling miles on foot through the battered region.           Sen. Joe Manchin of West Virginia will not run for reelection in 2024, potentially threatening Democrats’ chances to hold control of the Senate. The moderate Democrat made the announcement on social media Thursday, calling it “one of the toughest decisions” of his life. The Democratic Caucus controls the chamber with a narrow 51-49 margin, and Manchin’s decision not to run again in such a deeply red state puts Democrats in a tough spot, as they’ll be defending seats in other competitive states. Manchin has not specifically said what he plans to do after leaving Capitol Hill, although he has stoked speculation of a third-party presidential bid.           Federal law enforcement officials are investigating reports of suspicious letters sent to public officials, a Justice Department spokesperson said Thursday. Public officials in California, Georgia, Nevada, Oregon, Texas and Washington state have reported receiving suspicious mail, with some suspected to contain fentanyl. Most of the letters appear to have targeted election offices. So far, more than a dozen letters have been reported and investigators are treating all of them as connected for now, officials said. The reports come against a backdrop of a tense political climate where election officials frequently face threats, harassment and disruptions around voting.           Mortgage rates dropped this week in the biggest one-week decline in a year. The 30-year fixed-rate mortgage fell to an average of 7.50% in the week ending Thursday, down from 7.76% the week before, according to data from Freddie Mac. It is the second straight week rates have declined after rising for seven consecutive weeks. Still, it’s unclear whether the lower rates will entice prospective buyers off the sidelines. Homebuyers have been stunned by surging rates that sent home loan applications and home sales down to a 13-year low in September.           The number of exemptions for required vaccines for kindergartners has reached a record high. New CDC data shows around 250,000 kindergartners are at risk for measles infection as a result of declining the MMR vaccine, which targets measles, mumps, and rubella. About 4% of kindergartners nationwide were not fully vaccinated with MMR or formally exempt from getting it but were allowed to attend school during a grace period. All states have laws requiring specific vaccines for students and all school immunization laws grant exemptions to children for specific medical reasons. But 44 states and Washington, DC, also grant religious exemptions, and 15 states allow philosophical or moral exemptions for children. Non-medical exemptions accounted for more than 90% of reported exemptions, the CDC said.

us,Federal jury convicts former Baltimore prosecutor Marilyn Mosby on 2 counts of perjury,https://edition.cnn.com/2023/11/09/us/baltimore-prosecutor-marilyn-mosby-convicted-perjury/index.html,"       Marilyn Mosby, Baltimore’s former top prosecutor who was thrust into the national spotlight after charging six police officers in the 2015 death of Freddie Gray, was found guilty of two counts of perjury for making false statements on loan applications for two Florida vacation homes, the Justice Department said.           Mosby, 42, pleaded not guilty last year to two counts of perjury and two counts of making false statements after authorities said she applied for the loans to withdraw money from her retirement accounts, tapping a CARES Act provision intended for those hurt financially during the Covid-19 pandemic, prosecutors said.           The former prosecutor is facing a maximum sentence of five years in prison for each of the two counts of perjury, the Justice Department said.           Mosby is also charged with two counts of making false mortgage applications for the vacation homes in another federal case which will be tried separately. A date for that trial has not yet been set, federal prosecutors said.           A federal grand jury indicted Mosby in January 2022 after authorities said she lied on the application by indicating she had “adverse financial consequences” due to the pandemic – even though she earned a gross salary of $247,955.58 that was “never reduced” in 2020, according to an indictment. She also failed to disclose she owed $45,000 in federal back taxes, it says.           She also allegedly said she would be the primary resident at one of the homes in order to secure a lower rate when she had already entered into an agreement with a rental management firm, the indictment says. She sold one of the homes for a $150,000 profit, The Baltimore Sun reported.           At the time, Mosby called the charges a “political ploy” and said she is “unequivocally innocent.”           CNN has contacted Mosby’s attorney for comment.           During closing arguments, Mosby’s lead attorney and federal public defender Jams Wyda said the case is “about a three-page form and what was in Marilyn Mosby’s mind when she filled it out,” CNN affiliate WBAL-TV reported. “The government spent time on things that don’t matter.”           Wyda said in court Mosby told the truth when she completed paperwork indicating the pandemic harmed her business, arguing she “established the business, put money into it and was working to make it profitable in 2020.”           “She qualified and she reasonably believed she qualified. She is innocent,” Wyda continued.           According to The Washington Post, Mosby said after the verdict outside the courthouse: “I’m blessed. I’m blessed. I have nothing else to say.”           Before becoming state’s attorney, Mosby graduated from Tuskegee University and Boston College Law School. During her studies at the latter, the Boston native worked in her hometown Suffolk County District Attorney’s Office and in two US attorneys’ offices.     Freddie Gray case fallout has put Baltimore ‘ahead of the game’ with police reform. There’s much work still to be done         After graduation, she prosecuted felonies in the Baltimore State’s Attorney’s Office from 2006 to 2011 before entering the corporate realm as a civil litigator. She decided in the summer of 2013 to run for the Baltimore state’s attorney post.         She won and took office in January 2015.           On April 12, 2015, Freddie Gray encountered police officers in a high-crime area notorious for drug dealing. Gray, after making eye contact with police, ran. The officers arrested him on a weapons charge after finding a knife in his pocket, according to prosecutors.           Gray was put into the back of a police van without cameras, “handcuffed, shackled by his feet and unrestrained.” He was found unresponsive 40 minutes later upon arriving at the police station, prosecutors said. After slipping into a coma, Gray died one week later from a spinal cord injury. The medical examiner’s office ruled his death a homicide.           Less than two weeks after Gray was killed, Mosby charged six officers with misconduct along with assault, manslaughter or murder counts in the young man’s death.           While Gray’s death served as a rallying point for those decrying police brutality, none of the officers was convicted, despite the city paying Gray’s family $6.4 million. Three were tried and acquitted, prompting Mosby to drop charges against the remaining three because of the “dismal likelihood” they’d be convicted, describing the decision as “agonizing.”           Within weeks, five of the officers sued Mosby, alleging false arrest, defamation and other misdeeds. A federal appeals court ruled Mosby had immunity, and the US Supreme Court declined to hear an appeal, WBAL reported.     Despite the failed prosecution, the case instigated a new push for stronger police accountability laws and set the precedent in Baltimore and in cities across the country for implementing police reform, CNN previously reported.           As a result of the case, officers are now mandated to seat belt those in custody, call a medic when it’s requested, and intervene when fellow officers cross the line, Mosby told CNN in 2021. Additionally, all police vans must be equipped with cameras.           In 2021, Mosby announced she would not prosecute drug possession and other low-level offenses, asserting there is “no public safety value.” For Black Americans, Mosby said, “These offenses can lead to a death sentence.”     CNN’s Raja Razek and Taylor Romine contributed to this report.  © 2023 Cable News Network.

us,"NYPD investigating potential ‘bias incident’ after father says he and his toddler were attacked, accused of supporting Hamas",https://edition.cnn.com/2023/11/10/us/new-york-attack-investigation-father-son-hamas-accusation/index.html,"       New York police say they are investigating a possible “bias incident” in which a father alleges he and his 18-month-old son were attacked in Brooklyn on Monday and erroneously accused of supporting the Palestinian militant group Hamas.           Ashish Prashar, 40, told CNN he was at a Brooklyn basketball court with his son on Monday when a woman charged at the pair and hurled slurs at them, threw her coffee at him and eventually hit him.           Prashar, who said he was wearing a traditional Arab scarf known as a keffiyeh, said the woman became upset after his toddler started to interact with her young son in what Prashar believed to be a lighthearted moment between the children.           Prashar said he reached for his phone to record the screaming woman, hoping that the camera would force her to calm down. But the woman became violent upon seeing the camera, he said.           “My whole goal was to protect my son,” Prashar said. “There was disbelief in the beginning when she called me a terrorist. But then it got worse, and it got more serious. I needed to protect my son and keep him at a safe distance.”           In video that Prashar captured on his cell phone, the woman is seen throwing her phone at Prashar. He said that was moments before she threw a cup of hot coffee at him and his son.     CAIR received an ‘unprecedented’ 1,283 reports of anti-Arab and Islamophobic bias in the last month, new data shows         “She threw her hot coffee in my face,” Prashar said. “I had just put my son down. It would have hit him in the face. I was mind blown.”           A witness went to check on Prashar, prompting the woman to grab her child and leave, he said.           Prashar’s son was unharmed, but Pashar said he received scrapes and bruises from the woman’s open-hand strikes and attempts to rip his phone away while he recorded.           The New York Police Department is investigating the incident as a possible bias incident but has not taken a suspect into custody, a spokesperson said.           The incident comes as Muslims, Palestinians and Jews in the US say they are becoming increasingly fearful of hate-motivated attacks as war between Israel and Hamas rages in the Middle East. Israel declared a military offensive against Hamas after the militant group’s surprise attack on the country on October 7, which left 1,400 people dead. Since then, Israeli attacks have killed more than 10,000 Palestinians in Gaza, according to the Palestinian Ministry of Health in Ramallah, drawing from sources in the Hamas-controlled territory.           Prashar said he went to police to report the incident knowing he had what a lot of victims don’t – video evidence of the alleged attack.           “I want it to stop,” Prashar said. “I don’t want a child to be stabbed 23 times in Illinois. I don’t want my child nearly scolded by hot coffee and I don’t want this to happen to another human being. I see those kids in Gaza and I see my child.”           The Council on American-Islamic Relations condemned the incident and called it emblematic of post-9/11 hysteria.           “This attack on a father with his young son is absolutely despicable and we urge law enforcement authorities to be swift and thorough in investigating and apprehending a suspect,” Afaf Nasher, executive director of CAIR’s New York chapter, said. “These bigoted attacks must stop.”           The NYPD defines a bias incident as an offense that is “motivated in whole or substantial part by a person’s, a group’s or a place’s identification with a particular race, color, religion, ethnicity, gender, age, disability, ancestry, national origin, or sexual orientation.”           The total number of bias incidents investigated by the department’s hate crimes task force in October (101) was 124% higher than the number investigated in the same month last year (45), according to the NYPD. Last month’s count includes 69 investigations of potential antisemitic crimes and eight potential anti-Muslim ones           Nationally, CAIR says it has received 1,283 complaints of Islamophobia and anti-Arab bias since Hamas raided Israel on October 7 - a 216% increase compared to the same time last year.    © 2023 Cable News Network.

us,Man is convicted of murder in deaths of 2 Dallas hospital workers and sentenced to life,https://edition.cnn.com/2023/11/10/us/dallas-hospital-shooting-conviction/index.html,"       A man who authorities said shot and killed two Dallas hospital employees while he was visiting the facility for the birth of his child last year was found guilty Thursday of capital murder, prosecutors said.           A jury convicted Nestor Hernandez, 31, in the October 2022 deaths of Jacqueline Pokuaa and Katie Annette Flowers, who were shot in the maternity ward of Methodist Dallas Medical Center, the Dallas County district attorney’s office said.           Upon conviction, Hernandez received an automatic sentence of life in prison without the possibility of parole, the office said.           “At the time this crime occurred I vowed to see that justice was done, and I am satisfied to say that’s what we’ve accomplished,” Dallas County District Attorney John Creuzot said in a news release. “I say this knowing that justice is no replacement for these two innocent lives lost nor does it repair the trauma inflicted on the staff, officers, and other families at the hospital on that tragic day. However, we have ensured that Mr. Hernandez will die in prison.”           CNN has sought comment from an attorney for Hernandez.           Hernandez was on parole in connection with a robbery case – and had permission to be at the hospital while his significant other gave birth – when the shooting happened on October 22, 2022, authorities said.           Investigators alleged Hernandez, while in a room with his girlfriend and a newborn in the hospital’s maternity unit, began accusing his girlfriend of cheating, pulled a weapon from his pants and hit her in the head.           Eventually, Pokuaa entered the room to provide services to the girlfriend, and Hernandez fatally shot Pokuaa, authorities said.           Flowers then entered the room and also was shot dead, authorities said. A police officer working for the hospital shot Hernandez in the leg, and Hernandez was arrested, police said.

us,October 7 was the deadliest day for Jews since the Holocaust. The Shoah Foundation is now documenting it,https://edition.cnn.com/2023/11/09/us/shoah-foundation-records-october-7-testimonies/index.html,"       “Every year at school in Israel we used to get a lecture from a Holocaust survivor,” said Tomer Peretz. “I was always getting bored listening to him like, ‘OK, OK, we got it, OK. So, they killed you guys. Let’s move on …           “‘It’s one of those things that happened and will never happen again.’”           But after Hamas fighters raided Israeli farms and villages, killing and butchering more than 1,400 Israelis and taking more than 200 hostages on October 7, Peretz agreed to tape his own testimony so that others would not just move on.           “Everybody has to do it. It’s a must. I don’t see any other option. People need to know,” he told CNN.           He was giving his testimony to the USC Shoah Foundation, which for years has collected the accounts of survivors of the Holocaust and subsequent genocides in countries like Cambodia and Rwanda.           Peretz, a Jerusalem-born artist who now lives in Los Angeles, was in Israel the first week of October for a family wedding. As the horror unfolded that Saturday morning, he knew that he had to help. He volunteered with Zaka, an organization that collects human remains after terror attacks so they can be buried according to Jewish tradition.           Peretz was sent to collect the bodies at Kibbutz Be’eri, where more than 120 lay dead.           “I was too coward to be on the side of the head. I didn’t want to see faces,” Peretz said of the gruesome process of bagging mutilated bodies and loading them into trucks. “And then my time to touch the body came. It was the first time.” He helped lift a woman’s body, pulling her up by the arm so someone else could slip a body bag underneath. Of a victim, he said: “She had no face … It looked like they, someone … didn’t want to leave a face.”           Sifting through some of the more than 50,000 Holocaust testimonies at the foundation, it’s easy to find eerie echoes, which Peretz once believed could never come again.           “I’d never touched a dead body before. I mean, I’d seen dead bodies,” said Anita Lasker-Wallfisch in her testimony recorded back in 1998. She survived the Holocaust in part because she was a cellist – a rarity at Auschwitz – playing an irreplaceable part in a death camp orchestra. “Somebody else came and we just put the body out. One body. Well, it didn’t take long before that was multiplied by thousands.”           “There were dead people covered by newspapers,” Alicia Rand remembers of the Warsaw Ghetto. “Once a day or so, there was someone coming with wheelbarrows and taking the bodies.” Rand recorded her testimony in April of this year.           “And I see it now that this hatred still lives on,” she told the Shoah Foundation. “And then people did say that it never happened.”           Robert Williams, a historian who now serves as the Shoah Foundation’s executive director, said they had an obligation to Rand and the other survivors to deal with the forms of antisemitism that continued after the Holocaust ended. “For the better part of a year, we’ve resolved that we need to begin taking testimony on contemporary antisemitism,” he said. “Then October 7 happened, and we had to ramp up our efforts very, very quickly.”           Within days, teams on the ground in Israel were taping testimonies. “It is immediate and that comes with benefits, and it comes with risks,” said Williams. “The individual will be able to recount with greater clarity and greater detail what happened to them. The challenge though is the trauma is also very fresh in their mind.”     The close-knit kibbutz that became home to a massacre         Amit Ades, a mother of three, remembered trying to keep her children quiet, distracting them with a Sponge Bob movie on an iPad during lulls in the violence as Hamas swept through her community. She described the ‘smell of war’ seeping in through the windows of their kibbutz home. She was ready to fight. “With the knife in my hand and the baby on the other hand trying to keep her not crying so no one will hear us,” she said. “And it went on … it felt like forever.”           Another survivor, Avi Shamriz, told the camera: “My village was destroyed by the Hamas … There is no village to return to.” His young adult son was kidnapped. The family has no idea where he is, or whether he’s alive or dead. “My son, he’s an innocent boy,” said Shamriz. “He didn’t harm them.”           “We thought it will never happen again,” said Maor Moravia. “They did worse than Nazis. The Nazis had … a little human in them just to gas us.” As they were led out of their kibbutz by the Israeli soldiers who eventually came to save them, Moravia told his children to look only at the ground in front of their feet, so they would not see the dead bodies of their neighbors and friends.           Williams said of taking the testimonies now: “It’s about providing a platform for the voices of survivors to echo for future generations.”           Peretz spoke in his account about experiences he is, for now, unable to tell his children.     “Lie to them. Don’t tell them the truth … Just lie to them,” Peretz recalled telling his father-in-law on October 7. That was the only time he cried in nearly two hours of testimony. In all of the videos CNN has seen, all survivors speak with a similar stoicism.           “I don’t want to speculate on what happens in the minds of those who are providing testimony,” said Williams. “But I imagine that the immediacy of the events that they are facing today, the ongoing war, the fact that they are worried about children, friends, family who have been taken hostage, living with the reality that neighbors have been murdered may be so overwhelming that their best way of coping at the moment is to be a matter of fact.”           The Shoah Foundation will return to every subject further down the line, maybe years down the line, to find out how they feel with the benefits of healing and hindsight.           But the foundation will not be taking testimony from Palestinian civilians, currently suffering as the Israeli Defense Forces seek to destroy Hamas in Gaza. “The reason we’re taking testimonies from October 7 is because it was an act of anti-Semitism that is squarely within our mission,” explained Williams. “That being said we are always happy to share our methodologies with organizations who are interested in taking testimony.”           Asked if there is any hope of resolving this now decades-old and seemingly intractable conflict between Israel and the Palestinians, Peretz takes a long pause before answering. “I think so … But I think we gotta go so low, so low,” he said. “Both sides I guess needs to get a big slap before something will come out of it.” This, he said, just might be that moment.

us,Apollo astronaut Frank Borman dead at 95,https://edition.cnn.com/2023/11/09/us/frank-borman-apollo-astronaut-obit-scn/index.html," Sign up for CNN’s Wonder Theory science newsletter. Explore the universe with news on fascinating discoveries, scientific advancements and more.   Apollo astronaut Col. Frank Borman, who commanded the first mission to orbit the moon, has died in Billings, Montana, NASA announced. He was 95.           “Today we remember one of NASA’s best. Astronaut Frank Borman was a true American hero. Among his many accomplishments, he served as the commander of the Apollo 8 mission, humanity’s first mission around the Moon in 1968,” said NASA Administrator Bill Nelson Thursday in a statement.           “In addition to his critical role as commander of the Apollo 8 mission, he is a veteran of Gemini 7, spending 14 days in low-Earth orbit and conducting the first rendezvous in space, coming within a few feet of the Gemini 6 spacecraft,” Nelson said.           Borman died November 7, according to the statement.           In 1967, Borman was a member of the Apollo 204 review board, which investigated a fire that killed three astronauts on Apollo I, according to NASA’s short biography. Borman would later lead the team that reengineered the Apollo spacecraft.           Borman continued his aviation work following his NASA career as the CEO of Eastern Airlines, according to the statement.           His death follows that of Apollo astronaut Thomas K. Mattingly II, who died October 31 at the age of 87.    © 2023 Cable News Network. A Warner Bros. Discovery Company. All Rights Reserved.  CNN Sans ™ & © 2016 Cable News Network."
us,‘We’re feeling this moment in our bones’: Death of Jewish protester has shaken his Southern California synagogue,https://edition.cnn.com/2023/11/08/us/california-israel-hamas-protest-death-thursday/index.html,"       Shock and grief have reverberated through the congregation of Temple Etz Chaim since one of its longtime members, Paul Kessler, fell and fatally struck his head during dueling Israel-Hamas war protests in Thousand Oaks, California, over the weekend, synagogue leaders said during a Wednesday night vigil.           The 69-year-old Jewish man, who supported Israel during the Sunday demonstrations, fell backward and suffered the fatal injury during an altercation with a pro-Palestinian protester and died at a hospital hours later, the Ventura County Sheriff’s Office said.           Though Kessler’s death has been ruled a homicide, investigators have yet to determine whether the incident was a hate crime or other criminal offense, in part because conflicting witness statements have made it difficult to determine the exact cause of Kessler’s fall, Sheriff Jim Fryhoff said.           Even so, the incident has provoked safety concerns for many in Thousand Oaks’ Jewish community, the synagogue’s senior rabbi, Ari Averbach, said during Wednesday’s vigil.           “We mourn that one of our own is killed in our community and we wonder if we are safe. This feeling is inherent in us as Jews,” the rabbi said.           But Averbach insisted that people should take comfort in the flood of support the synagogue has received in the wake of Kessler’s death.     California officials ask for the public’s help as they investigate the death of a Jewish man during Israel-Hamas war protests         Muslim and Christian community leaders have “reached out in love, condemning the violence of neighbor against neighbor” while messages of solidarity have been sent by “nearly every government official on every level and across the aisle,” the rabbi said.           As of Thursday evening, investigators still were looking for evidence of what happened during the interaction prior to Kessler’s fall, including whether the man fell because he was struck by another demonstrator. The sheriff’s office echoed its previous calls for anyone with footage or witness accounts to contact detectives.           So far, investigators have footage of what happened before and after the incident that led to Kessler’s death, but no video showing the incident itself,” the sheriff’s office said Thursday. Video of the incident “would be extremely helpful in this case and would undoubtedly show or could even refute criminal culpability,” the sheriff’s office said.           A suspect, identified only as a 50-year-old man from neighboring Moorpark, was interviewed by deputies at the scene, and his home was later searched, Fryhoff said. No arrest has been made.           Kessler and his wife have been members of Temple Etz Chaim since the 1990s, Averbach told CNN, noting that the father of two “wasn’t a troublemaker.”           “The family is really in shock and confused,” the rabbi told CNN. “Just a few days ago he was a normal retiree living in a quiet neighborhood and so for him to get caught up in all of this, it’s not what the family was expecting.”           Kessler had gone with a neighbor to the Sunday protest – part of the wave of demonstrations in cities across the US, either in support of Israel or to protest its retaliation for the October 7 Hamas attacks, which killed more than 1,400 people. Israel’s military offensive has killed more than 10,000 people in Gaza, according to the Palestinian Ministry of Health in Ramallah, drawing from sources in the Hamas-controlled enclave.           During Wednesday’s vigil, Rabbi Michele Paskow said she will remember that Kessler “stood up to defend Israel” and “wasn’t afraid.”           “We affirm life. We don’t want to hate,” she said. “And we don’t want to be hated.”           Averbach noted that the tragedy has struck the synagogue as they also mourn significant anniversaries for the Jewish community, including the 2018 Tree of Life synagogue shooting in Pittsburgh and the 85th anniversary of Kristallnacht – a series of violent Nazi attacks against Jews in Germany in 1938.           “We’re feeling this moment deep in our bones,” Averbach said. “We are carrying a lot with us in this moment. So this week’s news was shocking and appalling.”           Thousand Oaks Police Chief Jeremy Paris said the amount of antisemitism he has seen in the community in recent weeks has been “mind-blowing.”           “I’m so sorry what you’re going through,” Paris said to the congregation during the vigil.           “I’ve been telling many people that if you asked me six weeks ago about what’s happening in our community could happen, I would not believe you. My eyes have been opened,” the police chief said.           Since the war ignited in the Middle East last month, Jewish, Muslim and Palestinian communities have reported rising fears of hate-motivated attacks. The Anti-Defamation League reported a nearly 400% increase in antisemitic incidents in the days after Hamas attacked Israel on October 7.           The sheriff’s office will continue to have increased patrols and presence at local places of worship, but it has no “intelligence of any specific threats,” the office said Thursday.           Local investigators are still working to determine what occurred during the confrontation between Kessler and the pro-Palestinian protestor, including what caused Kessler’s fatal fall.           But witnesses – who were both pro-Israeli and pro-Palestinian – interviewed at the scene provided contradicting statements about the altercation and “who the aggressor was,” Fryhoff said Tuesday.           About 75 to 100 people attended the simultaneous protests, which were held at a large Thousand Oaks intersection by two groups identified as “Freedom for Palestine” and “We are Pro-Israel,” the sheriff said.     American Arabs, Muslims and Jews: How has the Israel-Hamas war changed you?         Sheriff’s deputies responded to the scene just before 3:30 p.m. after receiving several calls about a possible assault related to the protests, the sheriff said.           When they arrived, Kessler was lying on the ground and appeared to be bleeding from the head and mouth. Kessler was conscious and responsive at the scene and as he was transported to the hospital.           The suspect was identified at the scene, where he was cooperative and told deputies he had called 911 after Kessler fell during their altercation, the sheriff said.           At the hospital, Kessler was listed in critical condition and his status continued to deteriorate until he was pronounced dead shortly after 1 a.m., according to Dr. Christopher Young, Ventura County’s chief medical examiner.           An autopsy determined Kessler’s cause of death was blunt force head trauma and his manner of death was homicide, Young said Tuesday.           Kessler suffered injuries consistent with a fall, including skull fractures, brain swelling and bruising, and non-lethal injuries to his face, Young added           The sheriff’s office stressed Thursday that the homicide determination “does not translate to a prosecutable murder or manslaughter (gross, voluntary, or involuntary) case.”           “Rather, it establishes that Mr. Kessler’s death was not from natural causes, suicide, or unknown. His death being ruled a homicide simply means his death was caused at the hands of another,” the office said in a Thursday release.           After investigators get enough evidence to establish probable cause and possibly arrest a suspect, the district attorney’s office will decide whether to file charges, the sheriff’s office said.

us,Federal judge rules controversial Willow oil drilling project in Alaska can move forward,https://edition.cnn.com/2023/11/09/us/willow-oil-project-alaska-ruling-climate/index.html,"       A federal judge in Alaska dealt another blow to climate and Indigenous groups attempting to stop ConocoPhillips’ massive Willow oil drilling project, ruling Thursday that construction could move forward.           The project on Alaska’s North Slope – an area that holds 600 million barrels of oil – galvanized a groundswell of online opposition from youth concerned about climate impacts when the Biden administration approved it earlier this year.           In a Thursday ruling, Judge Sharon Gleason dismissed the groups’ claims and ruled that the federal environmental analysis underpinning the project’s approval is sound – meaning the project can go forward with construction starting this winter on Alaska’s North Slope.           The groups intend to appeal the ruling.           “While today’s ruling is disappointing, we are entirely confident in our claims, and plan to appeal to the higher court,” Alaska-based Earthjustice attorney Erik Grafe said in a statement. “Beyond the illegality of Willow’s approval, Interior’s decision to greenlight the project in the first place moved us in the opposite direction of our national climate goals in the face of the worsening climate crisis.”           Locally, the project has both supporters and detractors among Alaska Natives; it will be an economic juggernaut and bring considerable tax revenue to Alaska’s remote North Slope.           “Our self-determination that comes with those opportunities is going to be huge,” Nagruk Harcharek, president of the advocacy group Voice of the Arctic Iñupiat, told CNN. “It’s going to give us a little bit of hope for the future that we have a little bit more time to keep moving things in the right direction.”     Humanity just lived through the hottest 12 months in at least 125,000 years         The drilling operation will pump oil out of one of the fastest-warming places on Earth. The major drilling project on Alaska’s North Slope has galvanized opposition from young people like few others have.           Online activism against the project surged in the week leading up to the project’s approval; more than one million letters were written to the White House in protest, and a Change.org petition gained millions of signatures.           At the time, activists warned President Joe Biden to heed the voice of youth voters – who polling shows are more likely to be concerned about climate impacts. Advocates called the project a “climate bomb” that would harm local habitats and contribute to further melting in the Arctic, including polar bear habitat in Alaska.           Grafe, the deputy managing attorney in Earthjustice’s Alaska regional office, told CNN his organization anticipates ConocoPhillips will start making ice roads in December and blast gravel in January to start construction of gravel roads – after which construction could begin in earnest. Grafe said the longer construction season would also disturb more wildlife.     Greenland’s northern glaciers are in trouble, threatening ‘dramatic’ sea level rise, study shows         “That’s the stuff that is most harmful, because it’s permanent, and because of the loud noises and more traffic and its effect on caribou and all sorts of things in the summer,” Grafe said.           ConocoPhillips and the federal government have argued the environmental analysis federal officials conducted showed the decades-long oil project wouldn’t do serious climate and environmental damage.           The Biden administration’s own environmental analysis concluded the project would generate enough oil to release 9.2 million metric tons of planet-warming carbon pollution a year – equivalent to adding 2 million gas-powered cars to the roads.           Even though Gleason declined to stop spring construction while the legal challenge was heard, environmental groups have had past successes in her courtroom. In 2021, Gleason vacated ConocoPhillips’ federal Willow permits, saying the Trump administration’s environmental review failed to consider key climate and environmental impacts to wildlife in the area.

Five Republican presidential candidates faced off in Miami Wednesday night in the third primary debate of the 2024 election cycle as they vied to be an alternative to the party’s front-runner, former President Donald Trump. Among the sparring candidates, former South Carolina Gov. Nikki Haley, Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis and Vivek Ramaswamy dominated the debate as they traded barbs with each other and called for new leadership. Foreign policy was a primary focus as the candidates all pledged support for Israel and united in opposing Hamas, Iran and China. Trump skipped the debate — as he did the two previous ones. He was instead headlining a rally of his own just a few miles away in the Miami area.           The House Oversight Committee on Wednesday subpoenaed Hunter and James Biden, President Joe Biden’s son and brother, as House Republicans continue to search for whether the president committed an impeachable offense in connection to his family’s foreign business dealings. This marks the first time the panel has directly subpoenaed members of the Biden family as they ramp up their impeachment inquiry into the president. Republicans have said that based on the information they have received, members of the Biden family have cumulatively received over $24 million from foreign nationals over approximately five years, including from countries like China, Russia, Ukraine, Romania and Kazakhstan. The Bidens deny these allegations.           Israel claims it has destroyed 130 Hamas tunnel shafts amid an “expansion” of its ground operation in Gaza. “Soldiers are thwarting Hamas’ terrorist infrastructure,” the Israel Defense Forces said, pushing back against UN war crimes accusations. Israel declared war on Hamas on October 7 after militants killed 1,400 people in Israel and kidnapped about 240 others, according to the IDF. The ensuing Israeli assault on Gaza has plunged the strip into crisis, with mass displacement and severe shortages of food, water, fuel and medical supplies. Israel’s attacks have killed at least 10,500 people and injured more than 26,000 others in Gaza since the war began, according to a Wednesday report by the Hamas-controlled Palestinian Ministry of Health, drawing from sources in the enclave.           Hollywood actors are heading back to work after reaching a tentative deal with major TV studios Wednesday, ending the historic strike. The grueling actors strike had shut down production across the industry for nearly four months while the union negotiated with the studios over better pay and other issues. Terms of the agreement were not immediately disclosed but in a statement to members, the union called the scope of the billion-dollar deal “extraordinary,” noting it includes significant increases in pay minimums, AI protections, and a streaming participation bonus, along with better benefits. “We have arrived at a contract that will enable SAG-AFTRA members from every category to build sustainable careers,” the union told members.           Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg is facing allegations that he personally and repeatedly rejected proposals to improve teen mental health on Facebook and Instagram. According to newly unsealed documents, Zuckerberg shut down a proposal from his top executives that would have disabled Instagram’s so-called “beauty filters.” Critics say the face-altering technology allegedly harms teens’ mental health by promoting unrealistic body image expectations, but Zuckerberg asserted that there was “demand” for the filters and that he had seen “no data” suggesting they were harmful. Other newly unveiled allegations in the lawsuit accuse Meta of exploiting the psychology of adolescent brains and allege that Zuckerberg himself established goals for the company to increase the amount of time users spend on Instagram.

us,"CAIR received an ‘unprecedented’ 1,283 reports of anti-Arab and Islamophobic bias in the last month, new data shows",https://edition.cnn.com/2023/11/09/us/cair-unprecedented-surge-anti-muslim-bias-reaj/index.html,"        The Council on American-Islamic Relations (CAIR) has documented an “appalling” rise in reported anti-Arab and anti-Muslim bias incidents in the month since violence escalated between Israel and Hamas, the organization announced Thursday.           The nation’s largest Muslim advocacy group said it has received 1,283 requests for help and reports of bias in the month since the Oct. 7 Hamas attack on Israel. The organization said in 2022 it received an average of 406 complaints in a 29-day period.           The new data, CAIR said, reflects a 216% increase in requests for help and reported bias incidents compared to the previous year.           Corey Saylor, director of research and advocacy at CAIR, said in a statement shared with CNN that the data represents the largest wave of Islamophobic and anti-Arab bias the organization has recorded since then-candidate Donald Trump called for a Muslim Ban in 2015.     American Arabs, Muslims and Jews: How has the Israel-Hamas war changed you?         “The Islamophobic and anti-Palestinian rhetoric that have been used to both justify violence against Palestinians in Gaza and silence supporters of Palestinian human rights here in America has contributed to this unprecedented surge in bigotry,” Saylor said in the statement.           Throughout the year, CAIR records and monitors incidents of reported anti-Muslim and anti-Arab bias from local chapters across the country.           The new data reflects a sharp pivot from CAIR’s cautiously optimistic outlook earlier this year, when the organization published a report noting 2022 was the first time the US charted a decrease in anti-Muslim bias incidents since they began tracking such reports in the 1990s.           “One year of declining cases is not a problem solved; it’s a glimmer of hope,” the organization said in the April report. “Securing future declines has never been more urgent.”           But now, Saylor said, the violence in Israel and Gaza is contributing to an “unprecedented surge in bigotry” in the US. The organization again called on President Joe Biden to negotiate a ceasefire between Israel and Hamas.           Saylor also urged Biden to do more to address anti-Muslim hate, noting that President George W. Bush visited a mosque in the days after 9/11 to address the rise in Islamophobia.           All Americans including “political leaders, corporations, media outlets, civic organizations” have a role to play in combatting the increase in anti-Muslim rhetoric, Saylor said.    © 2023 Cable News Network.

us,California officials ask for the public’s help as they investigate the death of a Jewish man during Israel-Hamas war protests,https://edition.cnn.com/2023/11/08/us/california-israel-hamas-protest-death-wednesday/index.html,"       Southern California investigators are asking for the public’s help as they parse through conflicting witness accounts about what led up to the death of a 69-year-old Jewish man who fell and suffered a fatal head injury during dueling Israel-Hamas war protests in Thousand Oaks on Sunday, authorities say.           The death of Paul Kessler is being investigated as a homicide, and authorities have not ruled out the possibility of a hate crime, Ventura County Sheriff Jim Fryhoff said in a Tuesday news conference. A 50-year-old man who was detained cooperated with investigators and has not been arrested, he said.           Kessler was engaged in a confrontation with a pro-Palestinian protester when he fell, but the exact cause of the fall is still unclear, Fryhoff said.     American Arabs, Muslims and Jews: How has the Israel-Hamas war changed you?         “We’re still waiting to see evidence of what occurred in that interaction, and whether or not there was a blow to the face that caused the fall, or if Mr. Kessler fell, without that being the precipitating event,” Fryhoff said, urging people to come forward with video, photos or accounts of the incident.           Kessler, the sheriff said, was supporting Israel at the demonstrations – two among the many that have sprung up in cities across the US, either in support of Israel or to protest its retaliation for the October 7 Hamas attacks, which killed more than 1,400 people.           Israel has launched a military offensive that has killed more than 10,000 people in Gaza, according to the Palestinian Ministry of Health in Ramallah, drawing from sources in the Hamas-controlled enclave.           Kessler was still conscious and responsive when sheriff’s deputies arrived on the scene shortly before 3:30 p.m. Sunday. He was transported to a hospital, where he was listed in critical condition but died overnight as a result of his injuries, Young said.           A 50-year-old suspect has been cooperative with investigators and was interviewed at the scene, where he told authorities he had been in an altercation with Kessler, according to the sheriff. The suspect said he had been one of the people that called 911 requesting medical help for Kessler, he said.           The suspect, who has not been publicly identified, was detained later Monday afternoon as the sheriff’s office executed a search of his home, Fryhoff said. He was released after the search was complete and has not been arrested.           Though Kessler’s manner of death has been ruled a homicide, the medical designation does not mean a crime has been committed, Dr. Christopher Young, Ventura County’s chief medical examiner said Tuesday.     Jewish man dies from head injury following ‘interaction’ with pro-Palestinian demonstrator in California, authorities say         “It’s simply stating that the death occurred at the hands of another person or the actions of another person contributed to the death,” Young said, noting the district attorney’s office will determine whether the homicide warrants criminal charges.           Both Jewish and Muslim community leaders have mourned the tragedy and condemned violence amid rising fears of hate-motivated attacks reported by Jews, Muslims and Palestinians in the US as war rages in the Middle East.           Rabbi Moshe Bryski told CNN on Wednesday that Kessler’s widow, Cheryl, was “in a state of shock” after his death and that her son, daughter-in-law and close friends were with her.           “I made her aware that the Jewish world, not just locally, but from all over the world, wanted her to know that they are there for her with anything that she needs,” said Bryski, who is a rabbi at Chabad of the Conejo in Agoura Hills.           “She was overwhelmed by all the love and kindness and just wanted some time alone for now so she can grieve.”           Rabbi Ari Averbach, who heads Temple Etz Chaim in Thousand Oaks, of which Kessler was a member, said Kessler “wasn’t a troublemaker.”           “Just a few days ago he was a normal retiree living in a quiet neighborhood and so for him to get caught up in all of this, it’s not what the family was expecting,” Averbach said. “He wasn’t going protest to protest to get in people’s faces. This isn’t who he was.”           Averbach said the Kesslers joined his synagogue in the 1990s.           “Our community is devastated, our community is confused, and our community is worried. We’re trying to figure out how we move forward from here,” he said.           A vigil for Kessler was being held Wednesday evening at Temple Etz Chaim. Rabbi Michele Paskow told the audience the she will remember how Kessler wasn’t afraid and “stood up to defend Israel.”           “We affirm life. We don’t want to hate,” she said. “And we don’t want to be hated.”           In response to the incident, the sheriff’s office has increased patrols around both Muslim and Jewish houses of worship and community centers, Fryhoff said.           About 75 to 100 people were gathered during Sunday’s protests, which were held at an intersection in Thousand Oaks by two groups identified as “Freedom for Palestine” and “We are Pro-Israel,” Fryhoff said.           Before Kessler’s fatal fall, there had been no violent encounters during the nearly two dozen protests that have been held across the county since Hamas raided Israel on October 7, the sheriff said.           At about 3:20 p.m. on Sunday, the sheriff’s office received multiple calls about a possible assault related to the protests at the intersection, Fryhoff said.           When deputies and medical responders arrived at the scene minutes later, they found Kessler lying on the ground, conscious and responsive, according to the sheriff.           One video filmed at the scene shows Kessler lying on his back on the sidewalk, with blood on his face and on the ground. He places his hands on his head as a woman with a Palestinian flag on her back and a man lean over him, trying to help, the video shows.           The footage does not show the altercation that led to Kessler’s injuries.           Investigators determined that a pro-Palestinian protester had been involved in an altercation with Kessler, who at some point fell backward and hit his head on the ground, authorities said.           Investigators interviewed pro-Israel and pro-Palestinian witnesses at the scene who provided contradicting accounts of who the aggressor was in the interaction and how the altercation occurred, according to the sheriff.           Kessler was given medical aid by Ventura County Fire Department responders and taken to a hospital, where he was listed in critical condition, according to the sheriff.           His condition continued to deteriorate until he was pronounced dead shortly after 1 a.m., the medical examiner said.           An autopsy was performed and Kessler’s cause of death was determined to be blunt force head trauma, according to the medical examiner.           The autopsy also revealed Kessler suffered injuries consistent with a fall, including skull fractures, brain swelling and bruising, and non-lethal injuries to his face, according to Young.           Local government officials, as well as Jewish and Muslim community leaders, are imploring the community to be patient as authorities investigate the incident and condemning violence amid escalating tensions over the war between Israel and Hamas.           The Jewish Federation of Greater Los Angeles said in a statement Monday that it is “devastated” by Kessler’s loss and expressed its sympathy for Kessler’s family, adding that its leaders were waiting for more information about his death from law enforcement.           Still, the federation condemned violence against members of the Jewish community, saying it “has no place in civilized society” and vowing to “do everything in our power to prevent it.”           “We demand safety,” the statement said.           Rabbi Michael Barclay, of neighboring Westlake Village’s Temple Ner Simcha, said he has spoken to the Thousand Oaks police chief and the Ventura County sheriff and urged people to wait for the investigation results.     Opinion: This moment in history has created a perfect storm for antisemitism         “These are really good men I trust, and it’s really important to let them do their job,” Barclay told CNN. “’Never again’ is now, but at the same time we don’t need to make a fire.”           The rabbi encouraged anyone with footage of the incident to share it with investigators.           The Greater Los Angeles Area office of the Council on American-Islamic Relations said it is “deeply saddened by this tragic and shocking loss.”           “We join local Jewish leaders in calling on all individuals to refrain from jumping to conclusions, sensationalizing such a tragedy for political gains, or spreading rumors that could unnecessarily escalate tensions that are already at an all-time high,” the council said in a statement Monday.           It continued: “While we strongly support the right of political debate, CAIR-LA and the Muslim community stand with the Jewish community in rejecting any and all violence, antisemitism, Islamophobia, or incitement of hatred.”     CNN’s Ray Sanchez, Caroll Alvarado, Dakin Andone, Taylor Romine, Nouran Salahieh, Jillian Sykes, Stephanie Elam and Jason Kravarik contributed to this report.  © 2023 Cable News Network.

us,Massive chemical plant fire near Houston that forced a school to evacuate is almost out,https://edition.cnn.com/2023/11/08/us/houston-chemical-plant-fire/index.html,"       One person was hurt at a Houston-area chemical plant that caught fire and sent thick plumes of black smoke skyward Wednesday for hours before emergency responders managed to knock down most of the flames and hotspots, officials said.           A majority of the fire at the Sound Resource Solutions plant in Shepherd was under control Wednesday afternoon, Emmitt Eldridge, emergency management coordinator for San Jacinto County, told reporters. Officials were starting to “demobilize” the scene, but fire crews would stay there through the night, Eldridge said.           One person who was hurt in the incident is doing well, Eldridge said, without offering specifics. Geoff Harfield, the president of Sound Resource Solutions, said the person had been burned.           “So we’re all really just hoping that that goes well,” Harfield said. “As long as he’s OK, then we can fix the rest.” Officials hoped the employee would be released from the hospital in the coming hours, he said.           The fire, which started Wednesday morning prompted officials to tell nearby students to evacuate and residents to shelter in place. Eldridge said preliminary information shows a worker on a forklift noticed chemicals leaking from a container.           “He went to lift that container up and then he noticed that there was a fire near his ignition,” Eldridge said, adding he couldn’t comment further.           In response to a question about air quality, he said, that as of 4 p.m. CT, there “hasn’t been anything detected in the air.”           The facility, about 60 miles northeast of Houston, focuses on recycling and distributing chemicals, including acids and solvents, the company’s website says.           The Texas Commission on Environmental Quality did a two-day evaluation at the facility in February, Harfield said.           There were “no deficiencies, not even a suggestion as to what we could do better,” he said. “The company’s tried to be a good steward for 14 years.           “We’ve got a lot of work to do to figure out the incident itself, so I don’t want to comment” on that.           By late Wednesday morning, the area under a shelter-in-lace order had been reduced to a 1-mile radius from a 5-mile radius, the emergency management office said. Just a few hours later, officials lifted it entirely.           As the fire grew Wednesday morning, thick black smoke shot up from the plant as the flames kept burning near the ground, aerial footage from CNN affiliate KTRK showed.

us,"Woman dies in what is believed to be Arizona’s first fatal elk attack, officials say",https://edition.cnn.com/2023/11/08/us/arizona-elk-attack/index.html,"  An Arizona woman died eight days after an elk apparently trampled her outside her home in what is believed to be the state’s first fatal elk attack on a person, wildlife officials said Tuesday.           On October 26 at about 6 p.m., the woman’s husband arrived at their property in the Pine Lake community in the Hualapai Mountains to find her “on the ground in the backyard with injuries consistent with being trampled by an elk,” the Arizona Game and Fish Department said.         The man also noticed that a bucket of corn had been spilled nearby, the department said.           The man called 911, and his wife was transported to Kingman Regional Medical Center and then to Sunrise Hospital in Las Vegas. The husband told officers his wife had been put into a medically induced coma because of her injuries, according to the department.           The woman passed away on Friday, and the manner of death was determined to be an accident, the Clark County Coroner’s Office told the Kingman Police Department. The names of the woman and her husband have not been released.           The game department learned about the attack from a local resident on October 27, and the next day an officer put door hanger warning signs on homes in the area advising residents not to approach or feed elk, the department said.           The officer going door to door saw elk tracks in the victim’s yard after speaking with her husband and other residents, the game department added.           On Friday, the day the woman died, game officers again went door to door in Pine Lake, putting up hanger warning signs and two roadside signs all advising people not to approach or feed elk, the department said.           Five elk attacks have been reported in Arizona in the last five years, according to game department.           One of the main sources of conflict between people and wild animals is feeding, which causes wildlife to become habituated to humans, the department said. It cited an incident in 2015, when two children were injured when an elk circled their family’s picnic table while they were eating in the Hualapai Mountains. It also cited an incident in 2021, when a woman suffered serious head injuries from an elk “that was habituated to humans” in Pine Lake.           A Utah State University study published in 2019 said information about the number of people in the US injured by “free-ranging herbivores,” such as elk, is scarce. The study found three documented non-fatal injuries to humans by elk in the US in 2018, all of which happened at Yellowstone National Park. The park is mostly in Wyoming but also spreads into parts of Montana and Idaho.           “The public is urged to help keep wildlife wild,” the Arizona game department said. “Wildlife that are fed by people, or that get food sources from items such as unsecured garbage or pet food, lose their natural fear of humans and become dependent on unnatural food sources. Feeding puts at risk the person doing the feeding, their neighbors, and the wildlife itself. Please do not feed wildlife.”    © 2023 Cable News Network. A Warner Bros. Discovery Company.

us,Authorities are investigating online posts showing Nashville school shooter’s writings,https://edition.cnn.com/2023/11/06/us/nashville-investigation-shooter-online-writings/index.html,"       Nashville police say an investigation began Monday morning into three photographs that surfaced online of writings connected to the March shooting at a private Christian school that left three 9-year-olds and three adults dead.         The writings are from the 28-year-old shooter, who was a former student at The Covenant School, Nashville Police Chief John Drake later confirmed. Police shot and killed the shooter during the attack.           The pictures, which were released by a conservative political commentator Monday, come amid an intense legal battle among groups who want evidence – including the writings – released by authorities and parents who say their release would cause further trauma.           “This police department is extremely serious about the investigation to identify the person responsible,” the police chief said in a statement about the unauthorized release of the writings. “This action showed a total disregard for Covenant families, as well as the court system, which has control of the shooter’s journals at the present time due to litigation filed earlier this year.”           Seven people in the Nashville police department were put on “administrative assignment” to “protect the integrity of the investigation,” department spokesperson Noelle Yazdani said Wednesday. The assignments were “absolutely non-punitive” and all seven have full police power, Yazdani said.           In a news conference Monday night, a spokesperson for Covenant families who have opposed the release of the writings lashed out at the person who took the images and aided in their release.           “You’ve released evidence that was gathered in our most vulnerable moments,” spokesperson Brent Leatherwood, who is also a Covenant school parent, said. “How could you?”           “Parents and families came together to prevent this exact moment from happening,” Leatherwood said. “To prevent the revictimizing of our children and prevent further trauma to our families. Because we knew that these writings, these thoughts from the shooter, were heinous. We knew that they were evil.”           Steven Crowder, the prominent conservative figure who released the images, told CNN affiliate WSMV he does not regret sharing them online. Crowder, who has been accused of using homophobic and racist slurs in the past, said he released the pages for more transparency in the case.           The released pages use hate-filled language directed toward the school and children and include what appears to be a timeline of events seemingly leading up to the shooting.           Authorities have previously said the shooter had written extensively in a personal notebook about the attack.     What we know about the complex court fight over the Nashville school shooter’s writings         CNN has also previously reported about journals authorities found from the shooter which were described as being related to “school shootings; firearm courses.”           In a statement, Mayor Freddie O’Connell said he directed the city’s law department to conduct an investigation into “how these images could have been released.”           “That investigation may involve local, state, and federal authorities,” the mayor said. “I am deeply concerned with the safety, security, and well-being of the Covenant families and all Nashvillians who are grieving.”           CNN has sought comment from Leatherwood about the police department’s move to put seven people on administrative assignment.           The shooter’s writings have been part of a monthslong legal fight playing out in Nashville over the release of documents and records related to the March 27 shooting.     Parents of Nashville shooting victims urge court to deny release of shooter’s writings in new declarations         The case involves requests for public records filed by gun rights advocates and news organizations that are seeking to compel Nashville’s city government to disclose writings left behind by the shooter that could shed light on the motive for the attack – which could include the shooter’s journals and a suicide note.           Those petitioning to have the writings released – including The Tennessean newspaper – say the documents are public records and the First Amendment and the Tennessee Constitution grant public access to the records.           The National Police Association and the Tennessee Firearms Association, who are also suing for the records, argue lessons gleaned from the writings could benefit public safety by shedding light on the killer’s thinking.           But the parents of two of the three children who were killed have asked the court to deny Freedom of Information Act requests for the release of the shooter’s writings.           The church that runs the school also wants to prevent records from being released, and it is supported by many of the school students’ parents, who fear the release could cause “copycat attacks,” CNN has reported.          Erin Kinney, the mother of one of the students killed, wrote in June that those demanding for the release of the materials were helping the dead shooter accomplish “immortality” and she described her responsibility to protect the surviving victims from what she called “the unfathomable trauma of encountering sensitive material about the deaths of their siblings, friends, teachers; and most certainly to protect them from ever encountering the hateful, diseased words of the monster who slaughtered six human beings in their school.”           The mother said that the “mass murderer” should not get to speak from the grave “while our three children, along with the three adult victims are silenced in this life.”           A ruling is expected from the Tennessee Court of Appeals, the National Police Association said in a statement on Monday.           “The City of Nashville is not under any court order to keep the requested materials secret. They can comply with the demands of our lawsuit at any time and end the needless waste of time before the materials are examined and used to benefit the public and law enforcement alike,” the association’s statement said.           This week, the families of the school said they will continue to fight to keep the rest of the writings from being publicly released.           “Our parents are still committed, our families are still committed to doing everything we can to make sure that none of the rest of this sees the light of day because we don’t want our children to someday read this stuff and whatever else may be there because they’re disconnected ramblings, but they are connected by one thing: they’re evil,” Leatherwood said.    © 2023 Cable News Network.

us,Police investigating report of decapitated baby doll found underneath ‘Free Palestine’ flag in Ohio resident’s yard,https://edition.cnn.com/2023/11/08/us/ohio-decapitated-doll-free-palestine-flag/index.html,"       Detectives are investigating a report of a decapitated baby doll found underneath a “Free Palestine” flag in an Ohio resident’s yard, according to a police report.           Video from a neighbor’s camera shows a man in dark clothing approaching the flag and placing something on the ground at 10:25 a.m. on Tuesday, according to the incident report from the police department in Sylvania Township, a suburb of Toledo.           About eight minutes earlier, a similarly dressed man is seen mowing the grass in the center boulevard across from the home, according to the report.     Hate incidents spike in the US         It’s unclear whether the man mowing the grass is the same man seen on video approaching the flag, police said, citing the fact that the incident takes place too far from the camera.           Neighbors were also unable to identify the man mowing the grass, though they had seen him doing so previously, according to the police report.           When reached by CNN, police could not confirm whether the incident was being investigated as a hate crime.           Faten Odeh, interim executive director of Cleveland’s chapter of the Council on American-Islamic Relations, said Wednesday police should do their due diligence and consider a hate-crime charge.           “We should all feel safe in our neighborhoods and be able to display our heritage without fear of hate-filled retaliation from our neighbors,” Odeh said in a statement.     American Arabs, Muslims and Jews: How has the Israel-Hamas war changed you?         CAIR, the nation’s largest Muslim civil rights organization, has said reports of assault, intimidation and harassment against Muslims are on the rise since the outbreak of war between Israel and Hamas.           In a report published in late October, the Council on American-Islamic Relations said it received 774 complaints from October 7 through October 25, compared to an average 16-day period last year, when CAIR said it received about 225 complaints.           The non-profit said this is the largest wave of reports logged since late 2015, but cautioned the true number of incidents was likely much higher.

us,Ronen Zvulun/Reuters,https://edition.cnn.com/2023/11/09/politics/biden-diplomats-warn-middle-east-fury/index.html,"       The Biden administration has received stark warnings from American diplomats in the Arab world that its strong support for Israel’s destructive and deadly military campaign in Gaza “is losing us Arab publics for a generation,” according to a diplomatic cable obtained by CNN.           The cable underscores profound concern among American officials about the growing anger against the United States that erupted soon after Israel launched its operations against Hamas, following the militant group’s attacks in Israel on October 7 that left over 1,400 Israelis dead.           “We are losing badly on the messaging battlespace,” reads a Wednesday cable from the US Embassy in Oman, citing conversations with “a wide range of trusted and sober-minded contacts.”           The robust US support for Israel’s actions is being seen, the cable warns, “as material and moral culpability in what they consider to be possible war crimes.”           The cable from the embassy was written by the second-highest US official in Muscat and sent to, among others, the White House’s National Security Council, the CIA and the FBI. While it’s just one cable from a regional embassy, it provides a private snapshot of the alarm over the growing anti-US wave sweeping the Middle East.           Another cable obtained by CNN from the American embassy in Cairo relayed back to Washington, as part of a daily media summary, the commentary in a state-run Egyptian newspaper that “President Biden’s cruelty and disregard for Palestinians exceeded all previous US presidents.”           CNN has reached out to the State Department for comment.           President Joe Biden has been under growing pressure domestically and abroad over US support of Israel amid images of destruction in Gaza and the dire humanitarian crisis in the region. While the administration has resisted calls for a ceasefire, officials have worked to ramp up aid going into Gaza and pushed for humanitarian pauses to allow more assistance to flow into the enclave and to allow civilians to flee away from the fighting.           In recent days, US allies in the Arab world have made clear their deep anger at the humanitarian crisis in Gaza.           Last weekend, Secretary of State Antony Blinken attended a summit convened by the Jordanian foreign minister that was attended by the top diplomats from Egypt, Qatar, the United Arab Emirates, and Saudi Arabia, as well as the secretary general of the Palestine Liberation Organization.           At the summit, the Arab leaders called for an immediate ceasefire in Gaza while Blinken reiterated US opposition, arguing that it would give Hamas time to regroup and launch another attack on Israel.           The White House said Thursday that Israel had agreed to move forward with daily four-hour pauses of military operations in areas of Northern Gaza.           Blinken had an agreement in principle on the pauses after his meetings in Israel last week, even though Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu came out against the idea of humanitarian pauses on Friday, US officials told CNN. That was seen as the Israeli prime minister playing to his coalition, and the officials noted it was similar to when the Israeli government opposed humanitarian aid getting into Gaza before deciding to allow it.           Although Israel had already been instituting such pauses, American officials see this agreement as progress because the Israelis are using the language of “pauses,” which is something the US believes it can build on.           Still, within the administration, concerns have grown over US support for Israel.     CNN previously reported that some senior officials privately say there are aspects of Israel’s military operations they simply cannot stomach defending; calls for the US to back a ceasefire are growing among government employees; and others are distraught by the incessant images of Palestinian civilians being killed by Israeli airstrikes.           Biden has also been confronted by the frustration growing domestically.           The president was confronted by a protester calling for a ceasefire at a private fundraiser last week; pro-Palestinian protests have been a daily occurrence near the White House compound; and this week, one of the entrances near the West Wing was covered in bright-red handprints – meant to mimic blood – and words like “genocide Joe.”    © 2023 Cable News Network.

President Joe Biden has been under growing pressure domestically and abroad over US support of Israel amid images of destruction in Gaza and the dire humanitarian crisis in the region. While the administration has resisted calls for a ceasefire, officials have worked to ramp up aid going into Gaza and pushed for humanitarian pauses to allow more assistance to flow into the enclave and to allow civilians to flee away from the fighting.           In recent days, US allies in the Arab world have made clear their deep anger at the humanitarian crisis in Gaza.           Last weekend, Secretary of State Antony Blinken attended a summit convened by the Jordanian foreign minister that was attended by the top diplomats from Egypt, Qatar, the United Arab Emirates, and Saudi Arabia, as well as the secretary general of the Palestine Liberation Organization.           At the summit, the Arab leaders called for an immediate ceasefire in Gaza while Blinken reiterated US opposition, arguing that it would give Hamas time to regroup and launch another attack on Israel.           The White House said Thursday that Israel had agreed to move forward with daily four-hour pauses of military operations in areas of Northern Gaza.           Blinken had an agreement in principle on the pauses after his meetings in Israel last week, even though Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu came out against the idea of humanitarian pauses on Friday, US officials told CNN. That was seen as the Israeli prime minister playing to his coalition, and the officials noted it was similar to when the Israeli government opposed humanitarian aid getting into Gaza before deciding to allow it.           Although Israel had already been instituting such pauses, American officials see this agreement as progress because the Israelis are using the language of “pauses,” which is something the US believes it can build on.           Still, within the administration, concerns have grown over US support for Israel.     CNN previously reported that some senior officials privately say there are aspects of Israel’s military operations they simply cannot stomach defending; calls for the US to back a ceasefire are growing among government employees; and others are distraught by the incessant images of Palestinian civilians being killed by Israeli airstrikes.           Biden has also been confronted by the frustration growing domestically.           The president was confronted by a protester calling for a ceasefire at a private fundraiser last week; pro-Palestinian protests have been a daily occurrence near the White House compound; and this week, one of the entrances near the West Wing was covered in bright-red handprints – meant to mimic blood – and words like “genocide Joe.”    © 2023 Cable News Network.

us,Suspicious letters sent to election offices being investigated by federal law enforcement,https://edition.cnn.com/2023/11/09/politics/suspicious-letters-fentanyl-election-offices/index.html,"       Federal law enforcement officials are investigating reports of suspicious letters sent to public officials, a Justice Department spokesperson said Thursday.           “We are aware of the reports and the FBI and U.S. Postal Inspection Service are investigating this matter,” the department spokesperson said in response to an inquiry from CNN.           Public officials in California, Georgia, Nevada, Oregon, Texas and Washington state have reported receiving suspicious mail. Most of the letters appear to have targeted election offices.           Investigators are treating all the letters as connected for now, given the timing, a law enforcement official told CNN.           So far more than a dozen have been reported, the official said.           The FBI said it has “responded to multiple incidents involving suspicious letters sent to ballot counting centers in several states” but could not comment further on an ongoing matter. “The public can be assured that law enforcement will continue to keep the public’s safety as its top priority,” the agency added.           In a statement Thursday, Georgia Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger said Fulton County, Georgia – which includes large swaths of Atlanta – had been among the election offices in multiple states targeted with suspicious letters.           Officials in Georgia said the letter received by Fulton County was suspected to contain fentanyl.           “We’re working with our state and federal partners to determine if any additional Georgia officials are being targeted,” Raffensperger said. “Domestic terrorists will not trample on our right to free and fair elections.”           CNN previously reported that election offices across multiple counties in Washington state had received envelopes on Wednesday that contained powdery substances.           At a news conference Thursday, Raffensperger called on elected officials and political candidates to condemn the activity and invoked the death of his son to convey the seriousness of the matter.           “Some people like to call fentanyl a drug, but it’s actually poison,” he said. “It’ll kill you … very quickly and very easily. It’s very dangerous.”           “We lost our son five and half years ago due to fentanyl overdose. We know how deadly this stuff is,” Raffensperger said.           Fentanyl was found in an envelope received by election officials Wednesday in King County, Washington – home to Seattle – the county’s elections director Julie Wise told CNN.           Staffers opening the envelope Wednesday detected white powder and immediately isolated the letter, called law enforcement and evacuated the building, she said.           Wise said her staff did not read the contents of the letter, but she described the situation as eerily similar to one over the summer when another letter – this one saying that there should not be elections – was also later found to contain trace amounts of fentanyl. She said the US Postal Inspection Service investigated the earlier incident.           Wednesday’s letter arrived as officials were counting ballots following Tuesday’s local elections, and it prompted the evacuation of some 150 workers for about three hours, she said.           “It’s devastating” for the county’s election workers to be targeted in this fashion, Wise said. “They are human beings. They have families. They are here to do a job. They believe in democracy.”           But she said her team resumed work as soon as they could on Wednesday, undeterred by the incident.           “If anything, it’s fired us up even more,” Wise added. “It made us want to continue to do the important work of processing ballots. … We are not going to be broken down.”           In neighboring Oregon, an election office in Lane County – which is about 120 miles south of Portland – also received a suspicious piece of mail at their office on Wednesday, a county official told CNN.           In Texas, authorities were investigating a suspicious “letter containing an unknown substance” that was mailed to state Attorney General Ken Paxton’s office, the Texas Department of Public Safety spokesperson Ericka Miller told CNN. Miller said preliminary tests all “came back negative.”           The letter prompted the evacuation of two floors of a state office building in downtown Austin on Thursday.            While concerning, the timing of the arrival of the letters does raise questions among some law enforcement experts about the relative sophistication and seriousness of the threat.           “The near-simultaneous arrival of these letters seems to indicate they were also likely mailed at the same time, which can provide significant clues to investigators,” said CNN Security Correspondent Josh Campbell, a former FBI special agent who worked threat cases involving the US Postal Service. “US postal inspectors have sophisticated technology they can employ to track the sender of a particular letter down to the drop box it was placed in and the specific time of day it was mailed.”            The reports come against a backdrop of election officials facing threats and harassment, first ignited by false claims of a stolen election in 2020.           Voting rights activists and some state election chiefs have warned that the overheated political climate around voting has contributed to a wave of resignations and retirements by election officials around the country.           The US Justice Department has brought criminal charges against at least 14 people after creating a task force in 2021 to address threats against election workers, according to a recent department summary.           At Thursday’s news conference in Georgia, Fulton County Commissioner Robb Pitts said the letters show that there are “some crazy people out there who will go to any extreme to disrupt” US elections.           “It’s my personal belief that this is just probably a forerunner into what we can be prepared for in 2024.”     This story has been updated with additional information.

us,Christie to visit Israel this weekend,https://edition.cnn.com/2023/11/09/politics/chris-christie-israel-visit/index.html,"       Former New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie will visit Israel on Sunday, which will make him the first Republican presidential candidate to visit the country since the October 7 Hamas attacks.           Christie, who has made US leadership on the world stage a focal point of his campaign, confirmed the trip, which was first reported by CNN, at a New Hampshire town hall Thursday.           The former New Jersey governor said he would meet with families of people kidnapped by Hamas, as well as Israel Defense Force soldiers and Israeli government officials.           He’s also scheduled to visit so-called Gaza envelope region in southern Israel, according to an itinerary of the trip shared with CNN.           Christie told reporters on Thursday that the Israeli government reached out last week to invite him to visit.           “They said they appreciated the things I was saying and the stance I was taking and if I was interested in coming over, they would be able to welcome me, and I made the decision to come,” he said.           CNN has reached out to the Israeli government for comment.           In what might have been a preview of his discussions this weekend with Israeli officials, Christie urged Israel from the debate stage Wednesday night in Miami to protect both its territorial integrity and the safety of its civilians and to ensure that “Hamas can never do this again.”           “The fact is that Israel and their intelligence community failed. They failed here, and they failed the people of the State of Israel,” he argued, saying the US needs to work closely with Israel to improve intelligence-gathering in the region.           He also encouraged Israeli leaders to “keep your eye on the ball,” in terms of working with “reasonable” Arab nations and isolating Iran in the Middle East.           Christie told CNN’s Anderson Cooper on Thursday he believes conversations about a two-state solution in the region “had to have stopped definitively” in the wake of the Hamas attacks, though he previously has expressed support for that ultimate outcome.           “I think there can’t be any discussion right now about a two-state solution until you dispose with Hamas’ ability to be able to bring that kind of terrorist attack again,” he said on “AC360.”           This will not be Christie’s first time in Israel – he visited the country in 2012 in his first foreign trip is governor.           Christie, who met with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky in Kyiv just months after launching his 2024 presidential bid, has made standing up to US adversaries abroad central to his vision for America and has distanced himself from rivals who are reluctant to provide aid to allies in wartime.           “This is the price we pay for being the leaders of the free world,” he said Wednesday, accusing China, Iran and North Korea of working to support Russia because “dictators work together.”           After he returns from Israel, Christie is expected to deliver a foreign policy address at the Hudson Institute on Wednesday and to further lay out his worldview.           President Joe Biden visited Israel last month in an extraordinary wartime trip to Tel Aviv, where he expressed his support for the country’s right to defend itself, as well as advocated easing civilian suffering in Gaza.           At the time, Christie said he thought it was “the right thing” for Biden to go to Israel and show “physical solidarity” with the US ally.           Since then, Israel has expanded its ground operations in Gaza, and growing political divides have erupted in the US and around the world over whether a ceasefire should be implemented.           The White House announced Thursday that Israel had agreed to move forward with daily four-hour pauses of military operations in areas of northern Gaza.           Christie previously told CNN he didn’t think a humanitarian pause in Israel’s ground invasion of Gaza would ultimately lead to American hostages being able to get out of the region.           “Look, I would think if we could get Americans out that would be a goal for us to reach, but I don’t think that would happen. I think what Hamas would want is not a pause. They would want a guarantee that Israel would not invade Gaza at all. And we can’t give them that guarantee because of the attack they perpetrated on October 7,” he said late last month.

us,"Blinken denounces civilian toll in Gaza, says ‘far too many Palestinians have been killed’",https://edition.cnn.com/2023/11/10/politics/antony-blinken-israel-gaza/index.html,"       Secretary of State Antony Blinken on Friday gave one of his most direct condemnations of the civilian death toll in Gaza and said more needs to be done to “minimize harm to Palestinian civilians.”           Although Blinken commended Israel for its announcement of daily military pauses in areas of Northern Gaza and two evacuation corridors, he said that “there is more that can and should be done to minimize harm to Palestinian civilians.”           The top US diplomat has subtly shifted his messaging in the days since he departed the Middle East earlier this week to more directly voice condemnation of the civilian toll in Gaza and the US’ expectations for the Israeli government. However, he still has not condemned the Israeli government offensive and has continually voiced support for its right to defend itself.     Biden administration privately warned by American diplomats of growing fury against US in Arab world         “Far too many Palestinians have been killed. Far too many have suffered these past weeks,” Blinken said at a press availability in New Delhi at the end of a whirlwind trip that also included stops Israel, Jordan, the West Bank, Turkey, Iraq, Japan and South Korea.           “We want to do everything possible to prevent harm to them and to maximize the assistance that gets to them,” he said.           “To that end, we’ll be continuing to discuss with Israel the concrete steps to be taken to advance these objectives,” Blinken said, but declined to detail the specifics of those steps.           In Tokyo on Wednesday, Blinken described the US’ terms for a “durable and sustainable peace” in Gaza after the war, and on Friday he reiterated that “some progress” had been made in setting those “basic principles.”           “No forcible displacement of Palestinians from Gaza. No use of Gaza as a platform for launching terrorism or other attacks against Israel. No diminution of the territory in Gaza and a commitment to Palestinian land governance for Gaza and the West Bank and in a unified way,” Blinken said Friday. “These and some other ideas that we’ve put forward, and that others share, I think, can start to be the basis for what we need to do.”           “We have concrete plans, concrete things that we’re working on that that would” increase the amount of trucks with humanitarian aid reaching Gaza, Blinken said.           But “it’s always a process and moving from an understanding, moving from an agreement to the implementation is what we’re working on right now,” he added.           Blinken reiterated Friday that the US “will continue to focus relentlessly on getting our hostages home” and stopping the conflict from expanding.           Speaking in India Friday, Blinken said “some progress has been made” in the week since he met in Tel Aviv with Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and other Israeli officials, but “this is a process and it’s not always flipping the light switch.”           The White House said Thursday that Israel had agreed to move forward with daily four-hour pauses of military operations in areas of Northern Gaza. Blinken had an agreement in principle on the pauses after his meetings in Israel last Friday, US officials told CNN, though Netanyahu came out publicly against the idea just hours after the meeting. Those public comments were seen as messaging for his domestic audience and war cabinet, but one official noted that “every step of this is like pulling teeth.”           Blinken met Saturday with Arab counterparts in Jordan, and there was a clear divide between the US and regional leaders on the matter of a ceasefire.           On Wednesday at a meeting of the G7 Foreign Ministers, however, there was joint supported for humanitarian pauses -– not a ceasefire -– in Gaza “to facilitate urgently needed assistance, civilian movement, and the release of hostages.”           At a news conference following that meeting, Blinken said that “those calling for an immediate ceasefire have an obligation to explain how to address the unacceptable result that would likely bring.”    © 2023 Cable News Network.

Cash is king right now, but investors aren’t casting stocks away completely.           For the first time in years, cash is making investors money after the Federal Reserve last March began hiking ultra-low interest rates to their highest level in over two decades.           That’s led many on Wall Street to increase their holdings in money market funds, which are regarded as some of the most risk-free investments. Money market assets reached a record $5.71 trillion dollars in the week ended November 8, according to data from the Investment Company Institute going back to 2007.           But some investors say not to overlook opportunities in equities, especially since bond yields have begun to tread lower in recent weeks and could continue to decline in the coming months.           Yields jumped on Thursday, after Fed Chair Jerome Powell said in a speech that he’s unsure whether the central bank has adequately tightened monetary policy. The 10-year US Treasury yield rose to 4.63%, up from 4.52% on Wednesday. But yields remain far below the highs seen last month, and markets still largely expect that the Fed is done raising rates.           “I don’t think you’re going to see a breakout well above 5%,” said Emerson Ham III, senior partner at Sound View Wealth Advisors.           Ham says he sees opportunities in dividend growth stocks, whose declines this year mean they’re priced at attractive levels. Investors have turned away from dividend stocks this year, instead favoring higher-yielding bonds and Big Tech names that have soared on artificial intelligence hype.           “If you’re a believer that rates are going to go back down at some point in the future, this is the perfect time to start buying,” he said.           Dave Sekera, chief US market strategist at Morningstar Research Services, says he’s eyeing utility stocks. Utilities fell out of favor this year due to tough competition from surging bond yields. They’re also a popular defensive pick, since they provide a steady payout for investors and tend to hold up during economic downturns — a scenario that hasn’t played out this year.           The utilities sector has sagged 15% this year compared to the S&P 500’s 13% jump, making it the worst-performing sector of the benchmark index. The utility sector is trading at a roughly 10% discount, according to Sekera.           Investors also shouldn’t overlook small-cap stocks, says Matt Stucky, chief portfolio manager of equities at Northwestern Mutual Wealth Management Company.           Small-cap stocks have been battered this year by rising interest rates and turmoil in regional banks, since they have large exposure to financials. The S&P 600, an index that tracks the performance of smaller stocks, has slid 4.7% in 2023.           These stocks also tend to perform better during periods of economic recovery. But Stucky warns against trying to time when the economy could start to reaccelerate, considering that the outlook remains murky.           “It’s probably best that you keep that position in a portfolio and almost don’t look at it for the next year or so,” said Stucky.           Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell is leaving the door open for additional interest rate hikes to defeat inflation, he said Thursday in prepared remarks.           “We know that ongoing progress toward our 2% goal is not assured: Inflation has given us a few head fakes,” Powell said ahead of a conference hosted in Washington, DC, by the International Monetary Fund. “If it becomes appropriate to tighten policy further, we will not hesitate to do so.”           If the Fed hikes again, it will likely only be once and may come during the US central bank’s upcoming policy meeting in December, reports my colleague Bryan Mena.           However, investors are bullish about another pause in rate hikes next month, according to fed funds rate futures.           As Powell began to deliver his speech, he was interrupted by climate protesters who made their way onto the stage. It’s the second time in the past month that the Fed chair has been interrupted during an appearance, after he was escorted off stage in October at the Economic Club of New York, and it clearly raises questions about security.           After returning to the podium, Powell made it clear the Fed is carefully balancing the risk that inflation could reignite versus the risk that the central bank could cause unnecessary economic damage.

The Trevor Project, a suicide prevention organization for LGBTQ+ youth, is quitting social media site X, saying Thursday it is concerned about “increasing hate & vitriol on the platform targeting the LGBTQ community — the group we exist to serve.”           “If you’d like to keep up with our work supporting LGBTQ young people, we invite you to follow us on Instagram, TikTok, LinkedIn, and Facebook,” or on TrevorSpace.org, the group said in a statement about closing its account on the platform formerly known as Twitter. “No online space is perfect, but having access to sufficient moderation capabilities is essential to maintaining a safer space for our community.”           The move to leave X comes after months of concerns about hateful speech on the platform, as owner Elon Musk emphasizes his desire for what he calls “free speech” instead, reports my colleague Clare Duffy.

us,Ransomware attack on China’s biggest bank may have hit US Treasury market,https://edition.cnn.com/2023/11/10/investing/icbc-ransomware-attack-hnk-intl/index.html,"   Editor’s Note: Sign up for CNN’s Meanwhile in China newsletter which explores what you need to know about the country’s rise and how it impacts the world.         A US unit of the Industrial and Commercial Bank of China (ICBC) was hit by a ransomware attack this week that disrupted some of its systems, reportedly hitting liquidity in US Treasuries which may have contributed to a brief market sell-off on Thursday.           ICBC Financial Services, which is headquartered in New York, said in a statement that the attack, which happened on Wednesday, had been reported to law enforcement. It was in the process of investigating the incident and trying to recover from the cyberattack.           “We successfully cleared US Treasury trades executed Wednesday … and [repurchase agreements] financing trades done on Thursday,” it said in the statement.           Ransomware attacks are a form of cyber extortion. The perpetrator locks the victim’s data or networks and demands payment to unblock access.           The systems of ICBC’s head office in Beijing and other domestic and overseas units were not affected by this incident, nor was the ICBC New York Branch, the unit said.           State-owned ICBC is the biggest of China’s “Big Four” banks and the world’s largest lender by assets, according to S&P Global. On Friday, China’s Foreign Ministry said the bank was paying close attention to the incident.           It “has completed emergency handling and supervision in an effort to minimize risk impact and losses,” ministry spokesperson Wang Wenbin told reporters at a regular press briefing.           The Financial Times and Reuters quoted some market participants as saying trades going through ICBC were disrupted, which affected market liquidity. It’s unclear whether the incident contributed to the weak 30-year bond auction conducted by the US Treasury Thursday.           There was a “sharp selloff” in Treasuries after the auction, Ipek Ozkardeskaya, senior analyst at Swissquote Bank, wrote in a Friday note to investors, saying yields rose for a range of different bonds.           “Of course, the sudden jump in US yields hit appetite in US stocks yesterday,” she said. “The US bond auction brought along a lot of volatility, questions, and uncertainty.”           The S&P 500, the Dow and the Nasdaq all closed lower on Thursday.           China is a major player in the Treasuries market. According to the most recent data from the US Treasury Department, China held $805.4 billion worth of Treasury securities as of August. It is the world’s second largest foreign holder of US Treasury bills after Japan.           Globally, ransomware attacks have disrupted company operations and key public services. The issue has become a national and economic security concern for the administration of President Joe Biden.       CNN’s Wayne Chang and Reuters contributed reporting.  © 2023 Cable News Network.

us,Huawei launches its rival to Tesla’s Model S,https://edition.cnn.com/2023/11/10/cars/china-huawei-new-ev-launch-intl-hnk/index.html,"Markets     Fear & Greed Index                  Latest Market News        Editor’s Note: Sign up for CNN’s Meanwhile in China newsletter, which explores what you need to know about the country’s rise and how it impacts the world.         Huawei has launched a new electric vehicle (EV) that is designed to take on Elon Musk’s Tesla.           The Chinese tech giant began taking preorders of the Luxeed S7, its first sedan, on Thursday. Previously, it had sold SUVs.           The car, which has developed with Chinese automaker Chery, has a starting price of 258,000 yuan ($35,400) during the presales period. Regular sales will begin on November 28, the company said at a press conference on Thursday.           Richard Yu, the company’s consumer chief, unveiled the sleek four-wheeler onstage in the megacity of Shenzhen, saying it was equipped with a powerful high-voltage battery pack. He has previously said the S7 would surpass Tesla’s (TSLA) Model S “in every specification.”           The comparison may be a bit of a stretch, says Mark Rainford, an automotive industry commentator based in Shanghai who hosts the YouTube channel “Inside China Auto.”           “In all honesty, I think comparisons with the Model S may be a bit ambitious on most metrics that I can find information for,” he told CNN, noting that some performance metrics had not been fully released.           “Where the S7 does stand out though is the 800-volt platform, which should enable very fast charging. Tesla [doesn’t] yet use an 800-volt platform, so the S7 will have an edge in this area,” Rainford said.           The S7’s 800-volt battery pack, the thinnest in the industry according to Yu, is made by Chinese EV battery giant CATL.           A 15-minute charge will yield a driving range of 400 kilometers (249 miles), according to Yu, which surpasses the 347-kilometer range (about 216 miles) for Tesla’s Model S after a similar charging period.           “Our range exceeds the level of our peers,” he added.     ‘Where is the phone?’ Huawei keeps quiet about Mate 60 Pro but takes aim at Tesla         The US automaker, which no longer maintains a public relations team, did not immediately respond to a request for comment.           Rainford said while the range comparison had not been tested, it was possible due to the battery.           Tesla may have an advantage because of its strong Supercharger network in China, which has many stations, he said.           “Ease of finding a good charger … is of as much importance as its ability,” Rainford said.           However, at the equivalent of $35,400, the S7 is much cheaper than the most basic Model S, which costs 698,900 yuan or $95,800 in China.           Tesla has been forced to slash prices in China recently in response to rising competition in the world’s biggest auto market.           Although Huawei first made its name as a tech and telecoms giant, it has been hobbled in recent years by US export restrictions, which sent the company into a tailspin.           This year, it has made no secret of its ambition to make a comeback — and create a splash in the car world. It launched its first EV in 2021.           At a September event, the company teased the release of the S7 as well as the Aito M9, an electric SUV developed with another Chinese automaker, Seres.           Yu said at the launch event that an upgraded version of the Aito M7, which was first released last year, had received more than 86,000 preorders in just 50 days.           The S7 caters to female consumers — with a designated cosmetics drawer, mirror for touching up makeup and a place to stash away high heels when they’re ditched in favor of flat shoes for driving — according to Huawei.

us,Here’s why the UAW saving this Illinois auto plant is a ‘gigantic deal’,https://edition.cnn.com/2023/11/10/business/biden-fain-belvidere-plant-reopening/index.html,"Markets     Fear & Greed Index                  Latest Market News            General Motors, Stellantis and Ford have closed dozens of US plants since the beginning of this century. Only a handful have ever been brought back to life. Now the United Auto Workers union can add one more.           That’s why US President Joe Biden attended a UAW rally in Belvidere, Illinois, Thursday, along with UAW President Shawn Fain.           Illinois is not a political battleground state like Michigan or Ohio, which have far more auto plants. But Belvidere is ground zero for the union’s successful fight to stop plant closings in its just completed tentative labor agreements with Stellatis, GM and Ford.           It is the site of an assembly plant that was closed in February, leaving 1,200 hourly workers either without a job or forced to transfer to another plant far away from the rural Illinois city of 25,000, about 70 miles west of Chicago.           But that plant is now due to reopen as an assembly plant in 2027, building a new midsize pickup truck. In the meantime, it will start making batteries for electric vehicles and serve as a parts depot for the company. Workers who have been laid off who can’t get one of those jobs or don’t want to move away can get partial pay in the meantime that, together with unemployment benefits, can get them more than 70% of their normal pay.           “It’s definitely unusual that a plant is brought back to life,” said Jeff Schuster, global head of automotive for GlobalData, an industry consultant. The union often will try to bring plants back during negotiations, but typically with limited success.           And that success in the just-completed labor negotiations during the strike at Stellantis is why Fain and Biden both came to Belvidere on Thursday.           “Nobody thought we could accomplish what we accomplished. Re-open Belvidere? Forget it,” Fain said during remarks Thursday.           Biden recalled two massive auto plants that GM and Chrysler used to operate in his home state of Delaware, and what happened when they closed﻿.           “When they shut down, people lost their sense of pride. Neighborhoods were in real trouble. People wonder if they’re going to stick around, what was going to happen to their families,” he said. “So this opening Belvidere again is a gigantic deal as far as I’m concerned.”           It’s a big deal for Dawn Sims, a 24-year veteran of the plant and a third-generation Chrysler worker in Belvidere, She spoke at the event with Fain and Biden, talking about the stress she and co-workers were put under when Stellantis announced plans to close the plant.           “They were willing to tear apart families, they were willing to tear apart communities,” she said.           She said that with both a son and daughter in high school, she felt she couldn’t relocate her whole family.           “To keep my job, it would mean I’d have to leave my family,” she said. “These were the tough choices we were all having to make.”           Part of the union’s success was its unusual strike strategy. The union struck all three companies together for the first time in its history, but started with strikes at only one assembly plant per company, which gave it the opportunity to add to the scope of the strike six times as it repeatedly turned up the pressure at the bargaining table.           “It was a very different tactic that seemed to work,” said Schuster.           But what really helped were record profits and/or near-record profits at the automakers. Schuster said it’s much tougher to save jobs and stop plant closings when companies are struggling, losing billions and running short on cash, or even just treading water.           The union said that the three unionized automakers, the traditional Big Three, have closed 65 plants and facilities so far this century. Some of those jobs were lost to outsourcing, either to suppliers or in some cases foreign plants, and some to automation.           But much of the loss occurred due to lost market share. In 1999, data from Edmunds shows the traditional Big Three had total US sales of 11.5 million vehicles and 68% of the market. By last year, that had fallen by 51%, with US sales of just 5.7 million vehicles and only 41% of the market.           But with strong demand for cars helping fuel record car prices, the unions were in a strong position. “Record profits, record contracts” became one of its slogans on the picket lines.           Belvidere isn’t the first plant brought back to life. But it’s one of few.           In the past, just getting an automaker to drop future plans to shut down a plant was considered a win for the union.          That’s what happened with a plant in Sterling Heights, Michigan, operated by Stellantis predecessor Chrysler, which appeared slated for closing as part of its 2009 bankruptcy, and then again by 2012. But the plant has continued to operate to this day.           And it’s what happened with the last GM assembly plant in Detroit, its Hamtramck Assembly plant, that as part of the 2019 labor deal was closed in early 2020 and re-tooled to make electric pickups, reopening in November 2021.           Among the few plants that literally came back from the dead were GM assembly plants that were closed during the 2009 bankruptcy, including one in Spring Hill, Tennessee, and one in Orion Township, Michigan, that were revived as part of the 2011 labor deal.           But other plants that the union tried to save, including GM’s massive assembly plant in Lordstown, Ohio, and transmission plants in Warren, Michigan, and Baltimore have been permanently shuttered.

us,Ticket prices are plunging ahead of Formula 1’s next race set on the Las Vegas Strip,https://edition.cnn.com/2023/11/09/business/las-vegas-f1-ticket-prices/index.html,"Markets     Fear & Greed Index                  Latest Market News            Ticket and hotel room prices are falling sharply in Las Vegas as the gambling mecca preps to host its first Formula 1 Grand Prix race in four decades next week.           Excitement has “started to fizzle” in recent weeks with a “big factor” being that driver Max Verstappen already won this year’s championship title in Qatar on October 7, thus dampening enthusiasm among the sport’s fans as it nears the end of the season, according to TickPick CEO Brett Goldberg.           That has translated to falling ticket prices. According to TickPick, they have plunged 35% in the past month for the Saturday race, with the average “get-in” price dropping from $1,645 to $1,060 for grandstand seats. Tickets were priced at roughly $2,000 a year ago for the Las Vegas race.           Prices for practice on Thursday and qualifying races on Friday have also dropped dramatically. The current “get-in” price dropped about 50% from $385 to $180 for Thursday and on Friday, prices dropped nearly 60% from $825 to $342.           “The race garnered significant buzz when it was first announced and as more details came out regarding the track’s layout on the Strip,” Goldberg told CNN, adding that the event isn’t nearing the record-high prices for the March F1 race in Miami.         Prices could “easily change” following next Thursday’s practice, when fans will get to see the course snaking through the Strip in action, Goldberg added. Next weekend’s race is the first time it has been staged on the Strip, with the previous race being the Caesars Palace Grands Prix in 1981 and 1982.           Perhaps dampening excitement are the placement of the stands and track, which is making many parts of the Strip unrecognizable. The Mirage’s iconic volcano is closed until December and the Bellagio’s fountains that dance in front of the resort have also been turned off.           “Regardless, it presents a great opportunity for F1 fans and those visiting Vegas to attend a marquee event at an affordable price,” Goldberg said.           Lower prices are also hitting hotels rooms, too. The average price is hovering around $283 per night, according to Kayak data given to CNN. That’s fallen about 24% from what prices were averaging just a month ago.           Still, in true Las Vegas fashion, some hotels are going all-out with F1-themed weekends packages. MGM Resorts-owned Bellagio has sold out of a three-day luxury package for $12,000 per person that included VIP tickets, food and wine from celebrity chefs and sommeliers as well as access to private viewing decks overlooking the race.           With 100,000 attendees still expected, sponsors are seeing this as an opportunity. Heineken plans to promote itself by blanketing the city with its logo. Earlier this year, the brew extended its multiyear sponsorship of all F1 races through 2027 but sees the opportunity to bring its newly launched light beer, Heineken Silver, as that category experiences a shakeup amid the Bud Light fallout.   Another labor deal averts strike at eight more Vegas casinos         Las Vegas is the third US city to host an F1 race, after Miami and Austin. The popularity of the Netflix series “Drive to Survive” has been credited, including by the drivers, with growing the sport’s audience in the US.           In addition to the race, concerts and other events are scheduled. F1 claims that the race will generate $1.3 billion, making it the “single largest special event in Las Vegas history.”    Most stock quote data provided by BATS.

world,Ibrahim Dahman/CNN,https://edition.cnn.com/2023/11/10/middleeast/ibrahim-dahman-cnn-producer-escape-from-gaza-mime-intl/index.html,"   Editor’s Note: A version of this story appears in CNN’s Meanwhile in the Middle East newsletter, a three-times-a-week look inside the region’s biggest stories. Sign up here.         My wife woke me up early on Saturday, October 7, saying there were sounds of rocket fire outside. I went up to the roof of our house and saw a barrage of projectiles being fired from the Gaza Strip into Israel.           My two children – Zeid, 10, and Khalil, 7— followed me to the roof. There’s likely no school today, Khalil said.           I took my phone out and documented what I saw for CNN, my employer. I gathered my things and, as I did with each of the four wars I previously covered in the enclave, headed towards the CNN Gaza bureau in the Al-Rimal neighborhood – aptly situated next to Al-Shifa Hospital, Gaza’s biggest, and other news bureaus.           I asked my pregnant wife Rasha and the kids not to leave the house. Soon after, Israel began its bombardment campaign over Gaza, retaliating against Hamas’ rockets and deadly assault that day.           I covered the heavy airstrikes on residential areas until October 9, when the Israeli military warned that the neighborhood housing the CNN office would be struck. Then, Israel declared a “complete siege” on Gaza, saying it would block the supply of electricity, food, water and fuel to the enclave.           And therein begins the story of my displacement. As Israeli airstrikes battered the enclave, my manager in Jerusalem and I decided that I should move with my family to the Ayan hotel in the Al-Mashtal neighborhood by the coast, a sturdy building that would likely withstand shelling and shrapnel, and which has a basement that is often used as a makeshift bomb shelter. Gaza does not have bomb shelters for civilians.           There, my family and I slept and awoke to the sound of explosions for days. The area was being increasingly targeted by Israeli airstrikes.         We stayed there until October 12, when we decided to move to my sister’s house on Al-Jalaa Street. Missiles began raining down on residential towers near the hotel the second I left.           But we stayed at my sister’s house for only one night. The next morning, Israel called on all citizens in the Strip’s north – where we were – to evacuate southwards. I found a car and headed towards Khan Younis, a city close to the Egyptian border in the south, hoping to stay at the Crescent Hotel there.           Upon arrival, we were surprised to realize that the hotel was abandoned. It was uninhabitable. We then sought refuge in a house belonging to a family member in the Al-Amal neighborhood.           We stayed in Khan Younis for three weeks. Each day, we had to secure essentials for survival: food, water, power.         Throughout our time there, we worked to find potable water, which we could only purchase in limited quantities. Food was rationed. Lines at the nearby bakery would start at 5 a.m., and one could only buy up to 25 small loaves.           It was not long after that the bread ran out. We then started making our own.           Water used for showering and washing clothes was bought by the liter – around 250 Israeli shekels ($65) for 5,000 liters, which, in all honesty, we sometimes drank out of thirst.           Throughout our time in Khan Younis, we showered just three times, with cold water. And with each shower we came down with coughs, and infections.           I had to keep my devices charged, because losing battery meant being cut off from the rest of the world. Hospitals were some of the few places that still had power, so every day I would go to Al-Hilal Hospital in Khan Younis and sit on the floor while my phone and laptop charged.           I eventually installed solar panels on our roof with the help of local engineers, which luckily gave us power without needing to risk our lives by leaving the house. Airstrikes were taking place just 100 meters away.           As fuel ran out, we used everything from horse and donkey carts to bicycles as means of transportation.           It was a life of danger and exhaustion.           I took my children’s phones away, afraid of the trauma they would further endure by watching the war online. They had already experienced the horrors of bombs and rockets in earlier wars between Hamas and Israel.           Caring for children and my wife in these conditions tore my heart to pieces. One day I called my colleague Abeer Salman in Jerusalem and cried, and cried, and cried.           On November 3, I was told by my manager to head to the Rafah border crossing with Egypt, as our names were on a list of people to be evacuated that had been submitted by the US embassy in Israel.           I arrived at Rafah with my wife, who only had an identification card but no passport, and my two children who had nothing but birth certificates. They had never left Gaza before.           I was the only one with a passport, which expires in three months.           To our luck, and with the help of CNN and the American embassy, we were all allowed to enter Egypt on one passport. Upon entry each of my family members was issued a one-time travel document by the Palestinian embassy in Cairo, whose staffers were present on the Egyptian side of the crossing.           We were among the last 10 people to cross that day. In Egypt, I was greeted by my CNN colleague Asmaa Khalil, who had been waiting for me at the border.           In Cairo, some 320 kilometers (about 198 miles) from the border, we met with CNN colleagues Housam Ahmed, Mary Rogers and Sarah El Sirgany, who all helped to get us settled and provided much needed moral support.           The early hours of my escape were a relief. I had been a drowning man, frantically searching for something to grab onto in order to survive. In leaving Gaza, I was given a lifeline.           But as my fear and anxiety ease, I realize that peace remains distant.           My parents and siblings remain trapped in the enclave, sheltering in a school, surrounded by Israeli shelling. I am also haunted by our unknown fate: Where will we go from here? What is our future?           Endless memories come to mind as I recall the past month in Gaza, trivial but sad memories. When I fled my home, I asked my brother to release the pigeons I had been raising, fearing that they may starve if I’m away for long. Rasha had to leave her cat Lulu behind as the hotel we were heading to didn’t allow pets. Khalil, my son, was very attached to it.           I’ve covered many wars through the years. Nothing compares to the current conflict. Entire quarters in Gaza have been eviscerated, thousands of women, children and elderly have perished. What have civilians done to deserve this?           In Khan Younis, I was afraid to sleep, worried I would die in my sleep, unable to save myself or my family.           We have escaped the bombing, but our sleep is yet to return.    © 2023 Cable News Network. A Warner Bros. Discovery Company. All Rights Reserved.  CNN Sans ™ & © 2016 Cable News Network."

I found a car and headed towards Khan Younis, a city close to the Egyptian border in the south, hoping to stay at the Crescent Hotel there.           Upon arrival, we were surprised to realize that the hotel was abandoned. It was uninhabitable. We then sought refuge in a house belonging to a family member in the Al-Amal neighborhood.           We stayed in Khan Younis for three weeks. Each day, we had to secure essentials for survival: food, water, power.         Throughout our time there, we worked to find potable water, which we could only purchase in limited quantities. Food was rationed. Lines at the nearby bakery would start at 5 a.m., and one could only buy up to 25 small loaves.           It was not long after that the bread ran out. We then started making our own.           Water used for showering and washing clothes was bought by the liter – around 250 Israeli shekels ($65) for 5,000 liters, which, in all honesty, we sometimes drank out of thirst.           Throughout our time in Khan Younis, we showered just three times, with cold water. And with each shower we came down with coughs, and infections.           I had to keep my devices charged, because losing battery meant being cut off from the rest of the world. Hospitals were some of the few places that still had power, so every day I would go to Al-Hilal Hospital in Khan Younis and sit on the floor while my phone and laptop charged.           I eventually installed solar panels on our roof with the help of local engineers, which luckily gave us power without needing to risk our lives by leaving the house. Airstrikes were taking place just 100 meters away.           As fuel ran out, we used everything from horse and donkey carts to bicycles as means of transportation.           It was a life of danger and exhaustion.           I took my children’s phones away, afraid of the trauma they would further endure by watching the war online. They had already experienced the horrors of bombs and rockets in earlier wars between Hamas and Israel.           Caring for children and my wife in these conditions tore my heart to pieces. One day I called my colleague Abeer Salman in Jerusalem and cried, and cried, and cried.           On November 3, I was told by my manager to head to the Rafah border crossing with Egypt, as our names were on a list of people to be evacuated that had been submitted by the US embassy in Israel.           I arrived at Rafah with my wife, who only had an identification card but no passport, and my two children who had nothing but birth certificates. They had never left Gaza before.           I was the only one with a passport, which expires in three months.           To our luck, and with the help of CNN and the American embassy, we were all allowed to enter Egypt on one passport. Upon entry each of my family members was issued a one-time travel document by the Palestinian embassy in Cairo, whose staffers were present on the Egyptian side of the crossing.           We were among the last 10 people to cross that day. In Egypt, I was greeted by my CNN colleague Asmaa Khalil, who had been waiting for me at the border.           In Cairo, some 320 kilometers (about 198 miles) from the border, we met with CNN colleagues Housam Ahmed, Mary Rogers and Sarah El Sirgany, who all helped to get us settled and provided much needed moral support.           The early hours of my escape were a relief. I had been a drowning man, frantically searching for something to grab onto in order to survive. In leaving Gaza, I was given a lifeline.           But as my fear and anxiety ease, I realize that peace remains distant.           My parents and siblings remain trapped in the enclave, sheltering in a school, surrounded by Israeli shelling. I am also haunted by our unknown fate: Where will we go from here? What is our future?           Endless memories come to mind as I recall the past month in Gaza, trivial but sad memories. When I fled my home, I asked my brother to release the pigeons I had been raising, fearing that they may starve if I’m away for long. Rasha had to leave her cat Lulu behind as the hotel we were heading to didn’t allow pets. Khalil, my son, was very attached to it.           I’ve covered many wars through the years. Nothing compares to the current conflict. Entire quarters in Gaza have been eviscerated, thousands of women, children and elderly have perished. What have civilians done to deserve this?           In Khan Younis, I was afraid to sleep, worried I would die in my sleep, unable to save myself or my family.           We have escaped the bombing, but our sleep is yet to return.    © 2023 Cable News Network. A Warner Bros. Discovery Company. All Rights Reserved.  CNN Sans ™ & © 2016 Cable News Network."
world,Prince William is trying to reinvent the royal role,https://edition.cnn.com/2023/11/10/uk/royal-newsletter-scli-gbr-cmd-intl/index.html," Editor’s Note: This is a version of CNN’s Royal News, a weekly dispatch bringing you the inside track on Britain’s royal family. Sign up here.         There was a moment that fell under the radar while the Prince of Wales was in Singapore this week.           All eyes were on Tuesday’s glitzy award ceremony for his ambitious $50 million Earthshot Prize, which was held in Asia for the first time.           There, Prince William and a star-studded cast announced this year’s cohort of winner, but earlier in the week, the heir to the throne achieved his own, quieter, victory.           The Windsors overload their diaries when overseas, so it was no surprise that alongside his eco-initiative commitments, the 41-year-old prince filled his four days in-country with related engagements. One of those was his attendance at the first major overseas summit of his United for Wildlife project.     How Prince William’s eco-prize is already helping the planet         Set up by William and his Royal Foundation in 2014, the initiative assembles leading figures from conservation, government and law enforcement to halt the poaching of animals and prevent the illegal trade of their parts.           At that event on Monday, William delivered a passionate speech, emphasizing the far-reaching repercussions of the slaughter and sale of the world’s most endangered animals, and revealed a landmark global partnership to end the practice.           “I am delighted to announce today that United for Wildlife has led the creation of a world-first International Statement of Principles, agreed by governments to prevent, detect, and deter the financial activity that sustains the illegal wildlife trade,” the prince told delegates.           The United States, the United Kingdom, Australia, New Zealand, Canada, South Africa and Singapore are some of the signatories that have committed to regular cooperation. The hope is that the collective support will lead to more seizures and arrests.           William also announced a joint effort with the United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime and Interpol, in which the organizations will work together to disrupt the global criminal network.           One of the questions we’re often asked is about the real-world return from all the speeches, walkabouts and waving the royal family does. William’s announcements are one example of their convening power.           “I’m incredibly proud that our network has supported over 600 investigations, nearly 300 seizures of illegal wildlife products, and the training of over 110,000 people,” William said at the United for Wildlife Global Summit.     Prince William serves veggie burgers to stunned customers         Having this kind of quantifiable impact is at the core of William’s vision for his time as Prince of Wales.           Careful not to dismiss the work done by the rest of his family, who “have been very much spotlighting brilliantly,” the prince told the traveling British press that he wants “to go a step further.”           “I want to actually bring change and bring people to the table who can do the change if I can’t,” he said.           William explained that he didn’t want to dilute his impact by being spread too thin across numerous social causes. Instead, he’s been mulling over how he can go “deeper” and “show my intent more.”           The late Queen Elizabeth II put charity at the heart of her role. When Charles was Prince of Wales, he pushed boundaries with his activism and now, as King, he is engaging with subjects avoided by his ancestors. For William, rather than just highlighting issues, he is drilling down into causes he has backed for years and is now trying to deliver measurable change for them.           It’s a gamble when royals get involved in potentially divisive issues rather than just casting a spotlight on them. They can find themselves under fire from the court of public opinion or risk inching into the political space. But in a world of shifting attitudes, William’s action-based approach could make him the more effectual royal that critics have been calling for.    © 2023 Cable News Network. A Warner Bros.

world,China has a sweeping vision to reshape the world — and countries are listening,https://edition.cnn.com/2023/11/09/china/china-xi-jinping-world-order-intl-hnk/index.html,"   Editor’s Note: Sign up for CNN’s Meanwhile in China newsletter which explores what you need to know about the country’s rise and how it impacts the world.         Xi Jinping has a plan for how the world should work, and one year into his norm-shattering third term as Chinese leader, he’s escalating his push to challenge America’s global leadership — and put his vision front and center.           That bid was in the spotlight like never before last month in Beijing, when Xi, flanked by Russian President Vladimir Putin, United Nations Secretary General Antonio Guterres, and some two dozen top dignitaries from around the world, hailed China as the only country capable of navigating the challenges of the 21st century.           “Changes of the world, of our times, and of historical significance are unfolding like never before,” Xi told his audience at the Belt and Road Forum. China, he said, would “make relentless efforts to achieve modernization for all countries” and work to build a “shared future for mankind.”           Xi’s vision — though cloaked in abstract language — encapsulates the Chinese Communist Party’s emerging push to reshape an international system it sees as unfairly stacked in favor of the United States and its allies.     ﻿Viewed as a rival by those countries as its grows increasingly assertive and authoritarian, Beijing has come to believe that now is the time to shift that system and the global balance of power to ensure China’s rise — and reject efforts to counter it.           In recent months, Beijing has promoted its alternative model across hefty policy documents and new “global initiatives,” as well as speeches, diplomatic meetings, forums and international gatherings large and small — as it aims to win support across the world.           For many observers, this campaign has raised concern that a world modeled on Beijing’s rules is also one where features of its iron-fisted, autocratic rule — like heavy surveillance, censorship and political repression — could become globally accepted practices.           But China’s push comes as American wars overseas, unstable foreign policy election-to-election, and deep political polarization have intensified questions about US global leadership. Meanwhile pressing issues like climate change, Russia’s war in Ukraine and Israel’s assault on Gaza have sharpened discussion over whether the West is taking the right approach to respond.           All this coincides with longstanding calls from countries across the developing world for an international system where they have more say.           Many of those countries have substantially enhanced their economic ties with Beijing during Xi’s rule, including under a decade of his up to $1 trillion global infrastructure building drive, which leaders gathered to celebrate last month in the Chinese capital.           It remains to be seen how many would welcome a future that hews to China’s worldview — but Xi’s clear push to amplify his message amid a period of unrelenting tensions with the Washington elevates the stakes of the US-China rivalry.           And as the procession of world leaders who have visited Beijing in recent months, including for Xi’s gathering last month, make clear: while many nations may be skeptical of a world order pitched by autocratic China — others are listening.           A more than 13,000-word policy document released by Beijing in September outlines China’s vision for global governance and identifies what it sees as the source of current global challenges: “Some countries’ hegemonic, abusive, and aggressive actions against others … are causing great harm” and putting global security and development at risk, it reads.           Under Xi’s “global community of shared future,” the document says, economic development and stability are prioritized as countries treat each other as equals to work together for “common prosperity.”           In that future, they’d also be free of “bloc politics,” ideological competition and military alliances, and of being held responsible for upholding “‘universal values’ “defined by a handful of Western countries,” the document says.           “What the Chinese are saying … is ‘live and let live,’ you may not like Russian domestic politics, you might not like the Chinese political regime — but if you want security, you will have to give them the space to survive and thrive as well,” said Yun Sun, director of the China program at the Stimson Center think tank in Washington.     World leaders are lining up to meet Xi Jinping. Should the US be worried?         This vision is woven through three new “global initiatives” announced by Xi over the past two years focusing on development, security and civilization.     ﻿The initiatives echo some of Beijing’s long-standing talking points and are largely short on detail and heavy on rhetoric.           But together, analysts say, they present a case that a US-led system is no longer suited for the current era — and signal a concerted push to reshape the post-World War II order championed by it and other Western democracies.           That current international framework was designed to ensure, in theory at least, that even as governments have sovereignty over their countries, they also share rules and principles to ensure peace and uphold basic political and human rights for their populations.           China has benefited from that order, supercharging its economy off World Bank loans and expanded opportunities under the World Trade Organization, which Washington backed Beijing to join in 2001 in the hope it would help liberalize the Communist country.           Just over two decades later, Beijing is chafing under it.           The US and its allies have watched warily as Beijing has not only grown economically competitive, but increasingly assertive in the South China Sea and beyond and more repressive and authoritarian at home.           This has driven Washington’s efforts to restrict Chinese access to sensitive technology and impose economic sanctions, which Beijing sees as bald-faced actions to suppress and contain it.           The US and other nations have decried Beijing’s intimidation of the self-ruling democracy of Taiwan and tried to hold it to account for alleged human rights violations in Tibet, Hong Kong, and Xinjiang, the latter of which a UN human rights office last year said could amount to “crimes against humanity” — a charge Beijing denies.           In response, Xi has ramped up longstanding efforts to undercut the concept of universal human rights.           “Different civilizations” had their own perceptions of shared human “values,” Xi told leaders of political parties and organizations from some 150 countries earlier this year as he launched China’s “Global Civilization Initiative.” Countries wouldn’t “impose their own values or models on others” if China were setting the agenda, he implied.           This builds on Beijing’s argument that governments’ efforts to improve their people’s economic status equates to upholding their human rights, even if those people have no freedom to speak out against their rulers.           It also links to what observers say is growing confidence among Chinese leaders in their governance model, which they see as having played a genuinely positive role to foster economic growth globally and reduce poverty — in contrast to a US that has waged wars, sparked a major global financial crisis and faces fraught politics at home.           “All this makes China think America is quickly declining,” said Shanghai-based foreign policy analyst Shen Dingli, who says this feeds Xi’s drive not to overturn the existing world order, but revamp it.           Beijing, he added, sees the US as merely “paying lip service” to the “liberal order” to hurt other countries.           “(China asks) ‘who is more prone to peace and who is less capable of leading the world?’ This has beefed up China’s self-image, (and this idea that) ‘We are great and we should be greater — and we should let the world realize it’s our time,’” he said.           For strongmen leaders and autocratic governments, Xi’s vision has obvious appeal.           While Russia’s Putin, accused of war crimes and continuing his brutal invasion of neighboring Ukraine, and Afghanistan’s Taliban leaders are shunned in the West, both were welcomed to Xi’s table of nations in Beijing last month.           Just weeks earlier, Syrian dictator Bashar al-Assad — who has been accused of using chemical weapons against his own people — was feted at the Asian Games in Hangzhou, where he arrived on a Chinese-chartered jet and visited a famous Buddhist temple.           A headline in the state-run Global Times portrayed Assad’s visit as one from the leader of a “war-torn country respected in China amid Western isolation” — providing a glimpse into the through-the-looking glass scenarios that could become the norm if Xi’s world view gains traction.           But Beijing’s broader argument, which implies that a handful of wealthy, Western countries hold too much global power — resonates with a wider set of governments than just those at loggerheads with the West.           Those concerns have come into sharper focus in recent weeks as global attention has focused on Israel’s relentless assault on Gaza following the October 7 attack on its territory by Hamas. The US has been in the minority opposed to broad global backing for an immediate humanitarian truce — and its support of Israel is seen in much of the world as enabling the country to continue its retaliation, despite mounting civilian casualties.           In recent years, even some countries that have for decades embraced a close partnership with the US have drawn closer to China and its vision.           “Pakistan aligns with Chinese leader Xi Jinping’s view that a new global era is emerging, characterized by multipolarity and a departure from Western dominance,” said Ali Sarwar Naqvi, a former Pakistani ambassador, now executive director of the Center for International Strategic Studies in Islamabad.           But there are also many governments that remain wary of its politics and ambitions, or of appearing to side with Beijing over the West.           “We’ve kept our relationship with all nations open,” Papua New Guinea Prime Minister James Marape told CNN on the sidelines of the Belt and Road Forum last month, where he delivered a speech calling for more green energy investment in his country under the China-led initiative.           “We relate to the West, we relate to the East … We maintain a straight line, we don’t compromise our friendship with all people,” he said.           And while others may be ready to back China in calling for a more representative international system — there are questions about what that means under Beijing’s leadership.           “China can count on Brazil day and night to say that multilateralism is important, and we have to revisit global governance … however, there’s a very important ‘but,’” according to Rubens Duarte, coordinator of LABMUNDO, a Brazil-based research center for international relations.           He points to questions circulating within some countries, like Brazil, about why China is now championing concepts promoted in the Global South for 70 years — and claiming them as its own.           “Is China really trying to promote multipolarity — or does China just want to (become a) substitute (for) US influence over the world?” he asked.           For decades, China has built its international influence around its economic clout, using its own rapid transformation from a deeply impoverished country to the world’s second largest economy as a model it could share with the developing world.           It was in this vein that Xi launched his flagship Belt and Road financing drive in 2013, drawing dozens of borrowing nations closer to Beijing and expanding China’s international footprint a year after he became leader with the pledge to “rejuvenate” the Chinese nation to a place of global power and respect.           “China’s traditional (foreign policy) thinking was very heavily focused on economic capability as the foundation for everything else. When you become an economic power, you also naturally acquire greater political influence and soft power, et cetera — everything else will fall in line,” said Tong Zhao, a senior fellow at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace think tank in Washington.           But as China’s economic rise has come alongside geopolitical friction with the US and its allies, Beijing has seen the need to expand its vision “and tackle geopolitical issues as well,” Zhao added.           The war in Ukraine has only heightened this dynamic. China’s key economic partners in Europe tightened ties with the US and reassessed their relationships with Beijing after it refused to condemn the Kremlin’s invasion, while at the same time Washington shored up relations with allies in Asia.           This “served as a wake-up call to the Chinese that the great power competition with the United States, ultimately, is about (winning over) the rest of the world,” said Sun from the Stimson Center in Washington.           Then, faced with mounting pressure from the West to condemn Moscow’s invasion of a sovereign country, Beijing instead used the moment to argue its own view for global security.           Two months after Russian troops poured into Ukraine, Xi announced China’s “Global Security Initiative,” declaring at an international conference that “bloc confrontation” and “Cold War mentality” would “wreck the global peace framework.”           It was an apparent reference not to the Russian aggressor, but to NATO, which both Moscow and Beijing have blamed for provoking the war in Ukraine.           Xi’s words were far from new for Beijing, but Chinese diplomats in the following months ramped up their promotion of that rhetoric, for example calling on their counterparts in Europe’s capitals, as well as the US and Russia, to build a “sustainable European security architecture,” to address the “security deficit behind the (Ukraine) crisis.”           The rhetoric appeared to catch on, with Brazilian President Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva days after returning from a state visit to China this spring calling on Washington to “to stop encouraging war.”     China and Russia criticize Israel as divisions with the West sharpen         This gets to the heart of Beijing’s aims, which experts say are not to build its own alliances or use its military might to guarantee peace in volatile situations, as the US has done.           Rather, it looks to cast doubt on that system, while projecting its own, albeit vague, vision for ensuring peace through dialogue and “common interests” — a phrasing that again pushes back against the idea that countries should oppose one another based on political differences.           ‘“If a country … is obsessed with suppressing others with different opinions it will surely cause conflicts and wars in the world,” senior military official Gen. Zhang Youxia told delegations from more than 90 countries attending a Beijing-led security forum in the capital last month.           Beijing has said its model is already successful, pointing to its role brokering a restoration of ties between longtime rivals Saudi Arabia and Iran in March. It also dispatched an envoy to the Middle East following the outbreak of the latest conflict, pledging to “make active efforts” to de-escalate the situation — though Beijing’s readouts of his trip made no mention of any stop in Israel or Palestine.           But Xi’s rhetoric falls flat for many countries that see China and its rapidly modernizing military as the leading aggressor in Asia and which question its support for Russia despite Moscow’s flagrant violation of international law as it invaded Ukraine.Speaking to CNN in September, Philippine Defense Secretary Gilberto Teodoro Jr. accused China of bullying smaller countries as it expanded control of disputed areas of the South China Sea in violation of a ruling from an international tribunal.           “If we don’t (push back), China is going to creep and creep into what is within our sovereign jurisdiction, our sovereign rights and within our territory,” he said.           Beijing’s effort to broadcast its vision to reshape the world order is enabled by an extensive network of international organizations, regional dialogues and forums that it has cultivated in recent decades.           Bolstering those groups — and positioning them as alternative international organizations to those of the West — has also emerged as a key part of Xi’s strategy to reshape global power, experts say.           This summer both the China and Russia-founded Shanghai Cooperation Organization (SCO) security grouping and the BRICS group of emerging economies increased their numbers – and acted as a platform for Xi to promote his brand of geopolitics.           Countries should “reform global governance” and stop others from “ganging up to form exclusive groups and packaging their own rules as international norms,” Xi told leaders from Brazil, Russia, India, and South Africa after they invited Argentina, Egypt, Iran, Ethiopia, Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates to join BRICS — the group’s first expansion since 2010.           Weeks later, he appeared to underline his preference for his own alternative architecture — skipping out on the Group of 20 summit hosted by New Delhi, where US President Joe Biden and other Group of Seven leaders were in attendance.           But besides the splashy, high-profile events on China’s diplomatic calendar, officials are also broadcasting China’s vision and pitching its new initiatives throughout ministerial or lower-level regional dialogues with counterparts from Southeast Asia to Latin America and the Caribbean — as well as topical forums on security, culture and development with international scholars and think tanks, official documents show.           So far, China has appeared to have little trouble getting dozens of countries to at least cursorily back aspects of its vision — even if it’s typically not clear who all these supporters are or whether their backing comes with any tangible commitment.           China’s Foreign Ministry earlier this year claimed more than 80 countries and organizations had “expressed approval and support” for the Global Security Initiative.           According to Beijing, the economic-focused “Global Development Initiative,” launched in 2021 to support United Nations sustainability goals, boasts some 70 countries in its “Group of Friends” — hosted under the auspices of the UN.           This chimes with China’s long-held strategy to win broad backing for its position against that of Western countries in the UN and other international organizations, where Beijing has also been pushing for a bigger role.           But in addition to how much tangible support Beijing can garner, a key hanging question also remains over whether Xi’s ambitions are limited to efforts to dominate the global narrative and shift the rules in China’s favor or if he wants to truly assume a role as the world’s dominant power.           There is a broad gap between China’s power and military capacity relative to that of the US — and the potential for an ailing economy to slow its rise.           For now, experts say, China appears focused on shifting the rules to undercut American credibility to intervene or hold countries to account for domestic issues — be they civil conflicts or human rights violations.           Success doing that could have implications for how the world responds to any potential future move it could take to gain control of Taiwan — the self-ruled, democratic island the Communist Party claims.           But China’s actions in Asia, where its military has become increasingly assertive, while decrying US military presence, suggest to many observers that Beijing does hope to dominate the region.           They also raise questions about how a more militarily and economically powerful China would behave globally, if left unchecked.           China, however, has denied ambitions of dominance.           “There is no iron law that dictates that a rising power will inevitably seek hegemony,” Beijing said in its policy document in September. “Everything we do is for the purpose of providing a better life for our people, all the while creating more development opportunities for the entire world.”           Then, in an apparent reference to its own belief, or hope, for the trajectory of the US, it added: “China understands the lesson of history — that hegemony preludes decline.”    © 2023 Cable News Network.

world,Amazon deforestation falls more than 20% to its lowest levels in 5 years,https://edition.cnn.com/2023/11/10/climate/amazon-deforestation-falls-climate-intl/index.html,"       Deforestation in Brazil’s Amazon dropped by 22.3% in the 12 months through July, government data showed Thursday, as President Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva made progress on a pledge to rein in the destruction that happened under his predecessor Jair Bolsonaro.           Some 9,000 square kilometers (3,475 square miles) of Amazon jungle were destroyed in the 12 months through July, according to data from Brazilian space research agency Inpe, down from the 11,568 square kilometers cleared a year earlier.           It was the smallest area cleared since 2018, the year before Bolsonaro took office. The Amazon jungle is the world’s largest rainforest and its protection is seen as vital to curbing climate change.           “It’s an impressive result and seals Brazil’s return to the climate agenda,” said Marcio Astrini, head of advocacy group Climate Observatory.           Still, this year’s deforestation rate remains nearly twice that of the all-time low in forest destruction in 2012 and far from Lula’s pledge to reach zero deforestation by 2030.           Lula staked his international reputation on halting deforestation on assuming office this year and stepped up enforcement of environmental laws after four years of soaring destruction under Bolsonaro, who weakened environmental agencies.           Under the right-wing former president, destruction at the hands of ranchers, land speculators and miners surged to a 15 year high.           The annual data, produced yearly by Inpe’s PRODES satellite monitoring program, is far more accurate than its DETER alert system, which publishes weekly figures.           The official annual period is measured from August to July as there is less cloud cover in the middle of the year to obscure deforestation on satellite images.    © 2023 Cable News Network.

world,Russia parades Ukrainian war prisoners as ‘volunteers’ for its army in apparent violation of international law,https://edition.cnn.com/2023/11/10/europe/russia-ukraine-war-pow-video-intl-hnk/index.html,"       A group of former Ukrainian servicemen, including prisoners of war, have “volunteered” to fight on the front lines for Russia, Moscow’s state-run news agency RIA Novosti has claimed, in a potential violation of international law.           The agency released a video this week showing a few dozen men it said were Ukrainians wearing combat fatigues and holding rifles while taking an oath to Russia at a ceremony.  The full size of the unit is unclear.           According to RIA Novosti, the men are “volunteers.” CNN cannot independently verify if they joined the unit voluntarily or under duress. Ukraine has not commented on the report.           RIA claims the men are members of what it called “the first battalion of former Ukrainian Armed Forces soldiers – a volunteer battalion named after Bogdan Khmelnitsky.” Khmelnitsky was a 17th century military commander of Ukrainian Cossacks.           The battalion in October became part of a Russian operational combat tactical formation called Cascade, according to the news agency.           RIA reported in February the battalion had been formed “from prisoners of war of the Ukrainian troops” in the self-proclaimed Donetsk People’s Republic (DPR) in Ukraine’s occupied eastern Donetsk region.           The Washington-based think tank Institute for the Study of War (ISW), citing Russian state media, said in late October that Russia had “recruited” 70 Ukrainian prisoners of war (POWs) from various penal colonies.           Coercing POWs to serve in the Russian forces would be a violation of the 1949 Geneva Conventions, which have been adopted by all nations, according to the International Red Cross.           “Russian authorities have likely coerced Ukrainian prisoners of war into joining a ‘volunteer’ formation that will fight in Ukraine, which would constitute an apparent violation of the Geneva Convention on Prisoners of War,” the ISW said.           Dissident Russian soldiers aligned with Ukraine have staged headline-grabbing raids inside Russian territory, although their numbers are relatively small.           Russia and Ukraine remain locked in battle as the war enters a third winter with neither country’s forces establishing the upper hand.           In a publicly aired difference of opinion, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky this week pushed back against his commander-in-chief’s characterization of the state of the war after Gen. Valery Zaluzhny told the Economist, “We have reached the level of technology that puts us into a stalemate,” and “there will most likely be no deep and beautiful breakthrough.”    © 2023 Cable News Network.

world,Australia’s pact with Tuvalu aims to counter China’s influence in Pacific,https://edition.cnn.com/2023/11/09/asia/australia-tuvalu-climate-migration-intl-hnk/index.html," Australian Prime Minister Anthony Albanese on Friday signed a bilateral agreement with Tuvalu, aimed at countering China’s influence in the Pacific and protecting the tiny island nation from climate change.           The agreement, which Albanese said made Australia Tuvalu’s “partner of choice”, covers climate change, security and human mobility.           “The Australia-Tuvalu Falepili union will be regarded as a significant day in which Australia acknowledged that we are part of the Pacific family,” Albanese told a news conference in the Cook Islands where he is attending a meeting of Pacific leaders.           Australia will create a special visa for up to 280 Tuvaluans annually, 2.5% of the 11,200 population. Funds will also be provided for land reclamation in Tuvalu to expand land in the capital Funafuti by around 6%.           In a nod to China’s growing presence in the region, the agreement also requires the parties to consult before signing security or defence agreements with third parties.           Tuvalu is one of just 13 nations to maintain an official diplomatic relationship with Taiwan, as Beijing has made increasing inroads into the Pacific.           Australia will also provide security support if requested by Tuvalu, Albanese said.           While the full text of the agreement has not been released, the Sydney Morning Herald reported earlier on Friday that all 11,200 residents of Tuvalu would be offered refuge in Australia if climate change made the country uninhabitable.           The government press release following the treaty signing made no mention of mass climate asylum.           Tuvalu, a collection of nine low-lying islands mid-way between Australia and Hawaii, is one of the world’s most at-risk countries from climate change and has long drawn international attention to the issue.           Earlier this year, Tuvalu appeared at legal hearings at an international court in Germany, seeking an advisory opinion on the obligations of countries to combat climate change.           Former Tuvalu Foreign Minister Simon Kofe told the COP27 climate summit last year Tuvalu plans to build a digital version of itself, replicating islands and landmarks and preserving its history and culture.    © 2023 Cable News Network.

world,Ted Aljibe/AFP/Getty Images,https://edition.cnn.com/2023/11/10/asia/south-china-sea-philippines-water-cannon-intl-hnk/index.html,"       Manila accused Chinese ships of firing water cannons and making “dangerous maneuvers” toward Philippine vessels resupplying a remote military outpost on Friday, in the latest of a string of incidents between the two countries in the disputed South China Sea.           Philippine authorities said a Chinese coast guard vessel had fired water cannon against its vessel M/L Kalayaan in “an illegal though unsuccessful attempt to force [it] to alter course,” as it took part in a routine resupply mission to troops stationed on the BRP Sierra Madre in the Second Thomas Shoal.           The Philippines also claimed that vessels belonging to a Chinese maritime militia were involved in the harassment and that two Philippine boats were subjected to “reckless” and “dangerous” harassment by inflatable boats belonging to the Chinese coast guard.           The BRP Sierra Madre is a former US Navy ship the Philippines grounded in 1999 at the Second Thomas Shoal – known as Ayungin Shoal to Manila and Ren’ai Reef to Beijing – to enforce its claim to the area.           That claim is hotly disputed by China and the two countries have been involved in increasingly frequent run-ins in the highly contested waterway.           A spokesperson for China’s coast guard, Gan Yu, said in a statement that two small transport vessels and three marine police vessels from the Philippines “entered the waters adjacent to Ren’ai Reef in China’s Nansha Islands without the permission of the Chinese government.”     Tensions are flaring once more in the South China Sea. Here’s why it matters for the world         The statement claimed China has “indisputable sovereignty over the Nansha Islands and their adjacent waters, including Ren’ai Reef,” adding the “actions of the Philippine side infringe on China’s territorial sovereignty” and urging Manila to “immediately stop its infringing actions.”           The latest incident near Second Thomas Shoal in the Spratly Islands comes nearly three weeks after Beijing and Manila blamed each other for two collisions near the same area.           In its statement following the latest incident, the Philippines said it condemned “once again, China’s latest unprovoked acts of coercion and dangerous maneuvers against a legitimate and routine Philippine rotation and resupply mission.”           China’s actions had not only “put the lives of our people at risk,” but had “put into question and significant doubt the sincerity of its calls for peaceful dialogue,” it added.           Filipino troops stationed on the BRP Sierra Madre live under spartan conditions on the mostly rusted wreckage of the World War II era ship and rely on the regular delivery of supplies.           Despite the run-in Friday, the Philippine government said the resupply mission was completed.           Beijing claims “indisputable sovereignty” over almost all of the South China Sea, and most of the islands and sandbars within it, including many features that are hundreds of miles from mainland China, in defiance of an international court ruling in 2016 that sided with the Philippines.            The Philippine Embassy in Beijing has protested to the Chinese Foreign Ministry over the latest incident.           The South China Sea is widely seen as a potential flashpoint for global conflict. The recent confrontations between Manila and Beijing have raised concerns among Western observers that the disputes could potentially develop into an international incident if China, a global power, decides to act more forcefully against the Philippines, a US treaty ally.    © 2023 Cable News Network.

world,‘A death sentence’: British doctor flees Gaza but is sent back to war zone,https://edition.cnn.com/2023/11/10/uk/british-doctor-returned-to-gaza-hnk-intl/index.html,"       A British doctor who escaped Gaza with his family has been sent back to the war zone after Egyptian officials told him his name wasn’t on the list of evacuees, according to a British Member of Parliament.           Dr. Ahmed Sabra was in Gaza when Israel declared war on Hamas following the militant group’s October 7 attacks, said Geraint Davies, the local MP for Swansea West in Wales, where Sabra lives and works as a National Health Service consultant.           Davies shared video and voice notes Sabra recorded as he made the perilous trip with his wife and children to the Rafah crossing, where they had hoped to cross into Egypt and find safety before returning home.           But Davies said while Sabra’s family was allowed through, he was not on the approved list of foreign nationals.           “This is a death sentence,” Sabra said in a video Davies shared with CNN.           “I’m calling for the British government to do their duty and evacuate myself and other British nationals to safety to go back home,” he added.           Davies told CNN that neither he nor Sabra knows why he was not included on the list, and the MP said he has raised the matter with the UK Foreign Office           “He’s now been dumped on the street by the UK without shelter, 10% [phone] charge, and little data in a bomb zone. I wouldn’t wish this on anyone,” Davies said.           “He needs the help of the FCDO [Foreign, Commonwealth & Development Office] to get him home from danger with his family and wants the UK to do everything in its power to secure his safety.”           In the video and voice messages, the doctor said he and three other British nationals waited for two and a half days at the border for the British embassy to intervene.           Davies said Sabra was provided with food, drink, and a sofa to sleep on while he waited, but he was eventually sent on a bus back to Gaza.           He said Sabra told him he was in “daily contact” with the British Foreign Office and British embassy in Egypt before he was sent back to Gaza.           The UK’s Foreign, Commonwealth & Development Office told CNN on Thursday: “We’re working round the clock to ensure all British nationals in Gaza who want to leave are able to.”           “This involves submitting all details of British nationals and eligible dependents to the Israeli and Egyptian authorities. The authorities then review all cases and give permissions to cross.”           The statement said that the office is in contact with British Nationals in Gaza and UK teams are sent to the border to receive anyone allowed to leave.           It made no mention of Sabra’s case.           CNN also contacted the British Embassy in Egypt for comment.           More than 4,800 people signed an online petition as of Friday to call for the British authorities to speed up efforts to evacuate Sabra.           The British Islamic Medical Association said in a statement on Thursday they “demand urgent evacuation of Dr Sabra and other British nationals trapped in Gaza.”           More than 150 British nationals have left Gaza for Egypt via the Rafah crossing, according to British Foreign Office minister Andrew Mitchell.           They are among more than 2,000 foreigners who have been evacuated from Gaza since Egyptian authorities agreed to open the border on November 1, according to a CNN tally.    © 2023 Cable News Network.

world,"Hedgehog’s spines, anteater’s snout: A long-lost mammal is rediscovered in Indonesia",https://edition.cnn.com/2023/11/09/asia/long-lost-echidnas-hedgehog-indonesia-hnk-intl/index.html,"       Scientists have rediscovered a long-lost species of mammal described as having the spines of a hedgehog, the snout of an anteater and the feet of a mole, in Indonesia’s Cyclops Mountains more than 60 years after it was last recorded.           Attenborough’s long-beaked echidna, named after British naturalist David Attenborough, was photographed for the first time by a trail camera on the last day of a four-week expedition led by Oxford University scientists.           Having descended from the mountains at the end of the trip, biologist James Kempton found the images of the small creature walking through the forest undergrowth on the last memory card retrieved from more than 80 remote cameras.     Newly discovered pangolin species could aid in fight against extinction         “There was a great sense of euphoria, and also relief having spent so long in the field with no reward until the very final day,” he said, describing the moment he first saw the footage with collaborators from Indonesian conservation group YAPPENDA.           “I shouted out to my colleagues that were still remaining… and said ‘we found it, we found it’ - I ran in from my desk to the living room and hugged the guys.”           Echidnas share their name with a half-woman, half-serpent Greek mythological creature, and were described by the team as shy, nocturnal burrow-dwellers who are notoriously difficult to find.           “The reason it appears so unlike other mammals is because it is a member of the monotremes – an egg-laying group that separated from the rest of the mammal tree-of-life about 200 million years ago,” Kempton said.           The species has only been scientifically recorded once before, by a Dutch botanist in 1961. A different echidna species is found throughout Australia and lowland New Guinea.           Kempton’s team survived an earthquake, malaria and even a leech attached to an eyeball during their trip. They worked with the local village Yongsu Sapari to navigate and explore the remote terrain of northeastern Papua.           The echidna is embedded in the local culture, including a tradition that states conflicts are resolved by sending one party to a disagreement into the forest to search for the mammal and another to the ocean to find a marlin, according to Yongsu Sapari elders cited by the university.           Both creatures were seen as so difficult to find that it would often take decades or a generation to locate them, but, once found, the animals symbolized the end of the conflict and a return to harmonious relationships.    © 2023 Cable News Network.

world,This megacity is the latest to shut down as pollution chokes swathes of South Asia,https://edition.cnn.com/2023/11/10/asia/pakistan-india-pollution-new-delhi-lahore-intl-hnk/index.html,"       Lahore has become the latest megacity to shut down as pollution chokes swathes of South Asia, where nearly 50 million people have been breathing toxic air for nearly a week.           Pakistan’s second most populous city – of more than 13 million people – has shut schools and closed public parks, malls and offices after the air quality index (AQI) this week spiked to more than 400, according to IQAir. That number is considered “hazardous” by the Swiss air tracking company.           Authorities in Pakistan’s Punjab province have imposed an “environmental and health emergency” in three cities – Gujranwala and Hafizabad in addition to Lahore – until the situation improves, its chief minister Mohsin Naqvi said this week. The three cities combined account for more than 15 million people.           “There shall be a limited movement of people to and from these areas by public and private transport,” a statement from Naqvi’s office said Tuesday.           Naqvi’s government has also restricted the gathering of more than four people in one place.           The pollution spike in Pakistan comes after neighboring India saw smog blanket its capital New Delhi last week, as colder temperatures trapped pollution particles, creating a toxic haze that reached hazardous levels.     Toxic foam coats sacred river near New Delhi as Indian capital battles hazardous pollution         Traditionally, toward the end of the year after the winter harvest, millions of farmers clear their leftover rice stubble by setting fields alight to prepare for the incoming wheat crop. This, together with vehicular and industrial pollution, has created copious amounts of smog across the northern Indian states of Haryana, Punjab, Uttar Pradesh and New Delhi.           India’s Supreme Court this week ordered authorities in the states surrounding New Delhi to stop farmers from burning leftover crops, while also banning the use of firecrackers nationwide ahead of the upcoming Diwali festival this weekend.           The court has issued similar orders over the years with minimal effect.           Other major Indian cities, including Kolkata and Mumbai, also ranked on IQAir’s list of the world’s 20 most polluted cities this week, with pollution levels fluctuating between “hazardous” and “unhealthy.”           Local authorities have scrambled to implement measures to alleviate the pollution, from restricting vehicles on roads, sprinkling water on pavements and banning non-essential construction to reduce the dust.           Dhaka, the capital of Bangladesh, which has a population of more than 10 million people, also featured on IQAir’s list of most polluted cities, with an AQI that reached 222 on Friday, a number that is considered “very unhealthy” according to the company.           The PM2.5 levels in all these cities far exceed the World Health Organization’s limit and illustrate a growing concern for South Asian countries as they experience rapid industrializations and population booms that are fueling pollution levels.           PM 2.5 particles include pollutants such as sulfates, nitrates and black carbon, exposure to which can impair people’s cognitive and immune functions. They are also linked to lung and heart disorders.           Environment groups and policy makers have long called for more effective solutions to manage population growth, saying current measures such as restricting transport and halting construction make little difference in the long-term.           The effects of the worsening air are already visible in some parts of India.           According to a 2021 study by the Energy Policy Institute at the University of Chicago (EPIC), bad air could reduce the life expectancy of Delhi residents by as much as nine years.           The study also found that every single one of India’s 1.4 billion residents endures annual average pollution levels that exceed guidelines set by the World Health Organization.           Doctors in the Indian capital say they have seen an increase in pollution-related illnesses, with patients complaining of cough, throat irritation, shortness of breath and skin problems, among others.

world,"Russia has tried to break Ukraine’s energy grid. This winter, Ukrainians are prepared for the worst",https://edition.cnn.com/2023/11/10/europe/ukraine-energy-grid-russian-strikes-intl-cmd/index.html,"       Oleksandr Gindyuk is determined not to be caught off guard if electricity supplies fail again this winter. When Russia pounded Ukraine’s power grid with widespread and repeated waves of airstrikes last year, causing massive rolling blackouts, his wife had just given birth to their second daughter.           “It was quite difficult,”  Gindyuk, who lives with his family in the suburbs of the capital, Kyiv, told CNN. “There is no life in our house if there is no electricity. Without electricity, we have no water, light or heating.”           He has spent the summer preparing for Russia to repeat its strategy, which was designed to sow terror and make life unsustainable, robbing Ukrainians of heat, water and health services. “We are totally ready — we have a diesel generator and a powerful 9 kWh battery. We are not scared, we are ready,” Gindyuk told CNN.           As families like Gindyuk’s gird themselves for the possibility of another dark winter, Ukraine has been rushing to rebuild and protect its fragile energy infrastructure.     Ukraine is ready to start process of joining European Union, Commission says         The summer provided a respite for Ukraine’s power grid. Russia focused its attacks on military targets and on ports on the Black Sea and the Danube River, to hinder Ukraine’s efforts to move grain and choke off an important income stream.           As the days grow shorter and the temperatures drop, Russia has another opportunity to try to break Ukrainian resilience with punishing blackouts. But this winter, defense and energy officials say Ukraine is better prepared.           With limited Ukrainian air defenses in operation last year, Russia was able to target and hit the energy grid easily. This time around, the attacks will be harder for Russia to pull off, according to the deputy chief of Ukraine’s Defense Intelligence, Vadym Skibitsky.           “The Russians may use a combination of missile weapons and attack UAVs (unmanned aerial vehicles, or drones). These will definitely not be such primitive attacks as last year. It will be difficult for the Russians to achieve a result - we are also preparing and understanding how they act.”           DTEK, the country’s largest private energy company, has spent the past seven months restoring infrastructure, trying to boost output and bolstering defenses at its facilities across Ukraine.           “We restored what could be restored, bought back-up equipment and installed defenses around power plants,” DTEK chief executive Maxim Timchenko told CNN.           The company generates around a quarter of Ukraine’s electricity and runs 40% of its grid network, making it a prime target for Russian attacks. Four DTEK employees have been killed while on duty and its power stations have been attacked nearly 300 times since the start of the full-scale invasion, according to the company. “Last winter, determination carried us through. This winter we are stronger, and our people are more experienced,” Timchenko said.           Russia launched 1,200 attacks on Ukraine’s energy system between October 2022 and April 2023, with every thermal power and hydro-electric plant in the country sustaining some damage, according to DTEK.           In a damage assessment report released in June, the United Nations Development Programme said that Ukraine’s power generation capacity had been reduced to about half of what it was before Russia’s full-scale invasion. “Ukraine’s power system continues to operate in an emergency mode, which affects both power grids and generation,” a news release accompanying the report said.           The report also laid out a roadmap to rebuilding the energy sector, prioritizing decentralization, renewable energy sources and greater integration with the European Union. Ukraine has been hooked into the EU’s power grid since the full-scale invasion, allowing it to synchronize and trade power with the bloc. But the massive wave of attacks on energy infrastructure last winter threw that balance off kilter.           Much of the current focus remains on protecting the existing infrastructure, rather than rebuilding.           Physical barriers have been erected around Ukraine’s high-voltage electricity transmission network, which is operated by the national energy company Ukrenergo . “Our goal is to make Russian missile and drone attacks so inefficient that the enemy will give up on this idea,” Ukrenergo chairman Volodymyr Kudrytskyi told CNN.           There has been an effort to protect critical buildings with sandbags and metal cages to prevent damage from falling debris. Structures meant to protect against loitering munitions are also being constructed around some key energy equipment. But none of that can be a substitute for more air defense systems — a refrain that is echoed at nearly every echelon of government and across the energy industry.           “Of course, the key element for energy infrastructure protection is the air defense,” said Kudrytskyi.           Ukrenergo has said it has been able to fix some of the damage from last year and is ready to transmit the increased volumes of electricity needed for winter. “About half of the high-voltage grids were put out of operation after last season’s massive attacks. It takes months, and in some cases even years, to fully restore them,” Kudrytskyi said, underlining the scale of the undertaking.           The company has also prepared equipment reserves, trained repair teams and dispatchers to cope with the aftermath of possible attacks and set up back-up power supply chains for consumers.           Oleksandr Prokhorenko, the head of an electrical engineering company that installs energy storage systems across Ukraine, has seen a significant rise in demand as people prepare for outages by turning to off-the-grid solutions.           Management companies for high-rise apartment buildings have bought generators and accumulators — rechargeable, secondary batteries — to keep water pumping and elevators running. Businesses have upgraded to bigger generators that can keep the lights on for longer.           Hospitals have also been gearing up for power outages. According to the Ukrainian health ministry, all hospitals with in-patient facilities have generators to keep life-saving equipment working but long outages could mean scaling back on care.           “People continue purchasing generators, portable power stations and accumulators for the winter,” Prokhorenko told CNN.           Kateryna Serzhan is one of those equipping herself for the months to come. She and her two-year-old daughter spent last winter in the Spanish city of Valencia to avoid the power outages, but it meant being apart from her husband. This year she is determined to stay in Ukraine.           Serzhan said she knows the risks and, having bought a heavy-duty rechargeable battery, feels prepared for the worst. “If this winter is dark and cold, we are ready.

world,"Iran envoy says Tehran had no direct role in Hamas’ Israel rampage, or proxy attacks on US forces",https://edition.cnn.com/2023/11/10/middleeast/iran-says-no-involvement-hamas-attack-intl-hnk/index.html,"       Iran has reiterated that despite its financial backing and support for Hamas and other proxy groups in the region, it does not direct any of their actions, the Islamic Republic’s United Nations ambassador told CNN in an interview.           Amir Saeid Iravani, Iran’s envoy to the UN, was asked if Iranian support was the “connective thread” in attacks by Hezbollah in Lebanon on Israel, by Houthis in Yemen — including the shooting down of a US Reaper drone on Wednesday — and by Shiite militias in Syria against Israel and US forces.           Iravani said there was cooperation and collaboration, but that Iran was not directing any of those operations. He likened Iran’s role to that of the US in providing assistance to Israel.           “We have said very clearly that Iran is not involving in any attack against the United States forces in the region,” he said, adding that any attacks on US forces in Syria and Iraq were undertaken by others at “their own decision and by their own direction.”           Iravani’s comments came a day after the Pentagon announced two US fighter jets conducted an airstrike on a weapons storage facility in eastern Syria used by Iran’s Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC) and affiliated groups. US Secretary of Defense Lloyd Austin added that the “precision self-defense strike” was a response to a “series of attacks against US personnel in Iraq and Syria by IRGC-Quds Force affiliates.”           US and coalition forces have been targeted at least 46 times in Syria and Iraq since October 17 by one-way attack drones or rocket attacks.           In light of mounting fears of a wider regional war, Iravani said he has not had any “direct conversation” about containing the conflict in Israel with his US counterpart in the UN.     US forces have been targeted in 4 more attacks since US strikes in Syria on Wednesday         Tehran has long been accused of arming Hamas and other Iran-aligned groups in Lebanon, Syria, Iraq and Yemen, as regional attacks by its proxies have escalated and become increasingly frequent.           Iravani said Iran has “insisted that we are not going to expand this war front,” and has worked to calm allies in the region, but said others needed to do their part. He indicated the conflict could still expand if the fighting in Gaza continued.           The October 7 attack by Hamas saw militants rampage through parts of southern Israel on a murder and kidnapping spree that killed more than 1,400 people, mostly civilians, and saw about 240 people taken hostage, including women, elderly, and children.           CNN pressed Iravani as to whether Iran supported Hamas’ murder of women and children and its hostage-taking on October 7.           The ambassador responded that the question should go to Hamas, reiterating that Iran was not directly involved in the attack, and was neither consulted nor did they have any prior details about the operation.           Iravani said, “It is a war. It is a war which has been started 75 years ago.”           However, he then added, “If it were us, no. We will not do it.”           Days after the attack the US collected intelligence that suggested senior Iranian government officials were caught by surprise by Hamas’ actions, according to multiple sources familiar with the intelligence.           The sources stressed that the US intelligence community is not ready to reach a conclusion about whether Tehran was directly involved in the run-up to the attack, while they continue to look for evidence.           Hezbollah, the Iran-backed Shi’a movement based in Lebanon with one of the most powerful paramilitary forces in the Middle East, has also said that Hamas’ attack was kept secret from them.           Hezbollah Secretary General Hassan Nasrallah addressed speculation about whether Iran-backed factions were part of the attacks, saying that the planning and execution of the attacks were “100 percent Palestinian,” in his much-anticipated speech last Friday.           Nasrallah said he understood Hamas’ need for the element of surprise and said the October 7 attack caused a “political earthquake” in Israel and that it will have “lasting effects” on the conflict. He also viewed the attacks as a revelation of Israel’s military weaknesses.           CNN previously reported that Iran-backed groups were planning to increase attacks on US forces in the Middle East as Iran seeks to take advantage of a backlash in the region over US support for Israel in the wake of Hamas’ brutal attack on October 7.           Since October 7, and the increasingly frequent attacks on US troops in the region, the US has sent significant firepower to the Middle East as a deterrence to widening the conflict between Israel and Hamas, and in support of forces in the region.    © 2023 Cable News Network.

world,"14 killed in West Bank city of Jenin after Israeli incursion, Palestinian health ministry says",https://edition.cnn.com/2023/11/10/middleeast/palestinians-killed-west-bank-jenin-israel-incursion-hnk-intl/index.html,"       At least 14 Palestinians were killed in the refugee camp Jenin, in the occupied West Bank, following an Israeli military raid, according to the Palestinian Ministry of Health.           The incursion resulted in clashes with Palestinians early Thursday morning, the ministry said. It is not yet clear whether the deceased were civilians or militants.           The Israel Defense Forces (IDF) said that it conducted the Jenin raid to “thwart terrorist infrastructure” and to demolish the home of a man who allegedly killed an off-duty Israeli soldier in an August 31 ramming attack.           “Engineering forces uncovered explosive devices intended to harm our forces in the Jenin refugee camp,” the IDF said in a statement. “The commander of the Central Command signed a demolition order for the home of the terrorist who carried out the stampede attack at the Maccabim checkpoint and the Hashmonaim checkpoint.”           Israeli forces also launched at least one drone strike following clashes, according to Israeli Army Radio, the IDF, and eyewitnesses speaking to CNN.           Videos obtained by CNN and eyewitness account to CNN depict a heavy military presence in the city. Militants and Israeli forces can be heard exchanging gunfire. At least a dozen armored vehicles can be seen on the city’s roads, and armored bulldozers ripping up streets and destroying a house.           A video obtained by CNN shows leaflets being dropped on the camp following the operation. A resident shared an image of the leaflet with CNN. “Camp residents, the IDF’s activities inside the camp were a result of the terrorist operations that you support,” the leaflet read. “The IDF remains here and will return again and again until the terror is completely eliminated. The most excused is he who warns.”           One eyewitness told CNN that ambulances were unable to assist the injured, because Israeli forces surrounded the Ibn Sina hospital and blocked some ambulances from leaving. One video obtained by CNN shows multiple bodies lying motionless on the ground, covered in sheets with ambulance sirens blaring in the background.           The Israeli-Gaza war has increasingly spilled over into the West Bank with settler attacks and clashes leaving hundreds of Palestinians dead.           The Palestinian Ministry of Health said Thursday that the death toll in the West Bank has risen to 176. The Palestinians were either killed by Israeli forces or Jewish settlers, the ministry said. More than 2,450 Palestinians in the West Bank have been wounded since October 7th, it added.           Israeli forces frequently demolish the homes of people alleged to be involved in terror attacks.           The Jenin raid follows another demolition on Wedneday, when hundreds of Israeli police officers and IDF troops entered the Shuafat refugee camp in occupied east Jerusalem to demolish the home of a 13-year-old Palestinian boy accused of stabbing an Israeli Border Police officer in February, Israel Police said.           The officer, Sgt. Asil Suead, died on February 13 after being stabbed and then accidentally shot by security guard responding to the incident, the Jerusalem Border Police said at the time.           Several Palestinian residents told CNN that during the incursion to demolish the home on Wednesday, Israeli soldiers conducted “humiliating” searches of children on their way to school. Two videos obtained by CNN showed Israeli troops conducting searches of what appear to be teenaged girls in school uniforms stood against walls. Another video shows an officer aggressively holding a teenaged boy against a wall.           “Regarding the videos circulating on social media depicting searches involving women conducted this morning in East Jerusalem, it is important to clarify that these searches were carried out by a female Border Police officer,” the Israel Police said in response to a CNN question about the checks.           Hours later, videos obtained by CNN shows the forces surrounding the house and the explosion inside the refugee camp.    © 2023 Cable News Network. A Warner Bros. Discovery Company.

world,Reuters,https://edition.cnn.com/2023/10/31/europe/dagestan-riot-putin-hamas-balancing-act-analysis-intl-hnk/index.html,"       Russian President Vladimir Putin prides himself as the leader of what he calls a “multinational, multiconfessional” Russia. And the republic of Dagestan is in many ways a microcosm of Russia’s diversity: The mountainous region is home to over 30 ethnic groups with distinct languages.           But the images of antisemitic rioters overrunning Dagestan’s Makhachkala Uytash Airport have shaken Russia’s Jewish community, stoked international outrage and raised serious questions about the blowback from Putin’s war on Ukraine – now in the Russian leader’s view directly linked to events in Gaza.           On Monday, the Kremlin leader held an extensive meeting to address the situation in Dagestan, where rioters – fired up by rumors that Jews and Israelis were aboard a Red Wings Airlines flight that landed Sunday from Tel Aviv – surged into the airport terminal and stormed the runway.           Members of the crowd outside the airport held signs that included slogans such as “We are against Jewish refugees,” and “There is no place for child-killers in Dagestan.”           According to Russian state news agency TASS, “those gathered oppose the Palestinian-Israeli conflict.”           Authorities said at least 20 people were injured and 60 people were detained. State Department Spokesperson Matthew Miller said the incident “looked like a pogrom.”           The Israeli Prime Minister’s office and the Ministry of Foreign Affairs released a joint statement on Sunday following the news, saying Israel expected Russian law enforcement “to safeguard the well-being of all Israeli citizens and Jews wherever they are and to take strong action against the rioters and against the wild incitement being directed against Jews and Israelis.”     A new wave of antisemitism threatens to rock an already unstable world         In his remarks Monday, Putin called for law enforcement to take “firm, timely and precise actions to help protect constitutional order of Russia, rights and liberties of our citizens, the interethnic and inter-religious harmony.”           But the Kremlin leader also directed the finger of blame away from Russia.           “The events in Makhachkala last night were inspired through social networks,” Putin stated, insinuating that Ukraine and “the hands of Western intelligence agencies” had exploited emotions running high inside Dagestan over Israel’s relentless military campaign against Hamas in Gaza and rising civilian casualties.           “We can only help Palestine in the fight against those who are behind this tragedy,” Putin said, adding, “we, Russia, are fighting them within the framework of the Special Military Operation,” the official euphemism for Russia’s ongoing war in Ukraine.           Such remarks require serious unpacking.           Since the October 7 Hamas attacks, Putin has played a delicate international balancing act, putting himself forward as a potential mediator and calling for restraint on both sides – a position that has won praise from Hamas.           And in his remarks on Monday, Putin made his most pointed critique of Israel to date, saying that “horrifying events” in the Gaza Strip “cannot not be justified” and added that “your fists clench and you get tears in your eyes” when you see photos of “bloodied, dead children.”           Such images clearly stirred anger in Dagestan, a majority Muslim republic that has historically been home to a variety of Islamic religious practices.           It has a miniscule Jewish population – Judaism is one of Dagestan’s long-established religions, practiced by communities of the Mountain Jews, who speak a form of Persian – but after centuries of coexistence with Muslim neighbors, that population has dwindled through emigration.           But Putin’s calls to contain the Gaza crisis in recent days have riled Israel. Russia’s ambassador to Israel was summoned to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs in Jerusalem to protest a visit last week to Moscow by a Hamas delegation, according to a press release from Israel’s Ministry of Foreign Affairs on Sunday.           Putin, however, is playing to different audiences. Russia has a complex web of relationships in the Middle East: Putin backs Syrian President Bashar al-Assad (an enemy of Israel); he relies on Iran (another enemy of Israel) for a stockpile of drones to attack Ukraine; and he’s a high-fiving friend of Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, another power player in the region.           He has also maintained cordial working relationships with Israeli counterparts, although his relationship with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has cooled.           But such regional dynamics obscure a bigger picture. Putin has cast himself as locked in an existential fight against the United States and the West, with Ukraine the main battleground. His rhetoric – directed against “those who are behind this tragedy” – now appears to draw a direct line between Ukraine and Gaza.           In his remarks Monday, Putin accused the US of stoking the current conflict, stating “the United States needs constant chaos in the Middle East, so they discredit those countries that are insisting on the immediate ceasefire in the Gaza Strip.”           In response to Moscow, National Security Council Coordinator for Strategic Communications John Kirby said, “we’ve heard crickets from the Kremlin,” on the airport mob.           “Nothing, no condemnation, no calling for the stoppage of hate, discrimination and bigotry,” Kirby said, adding, “It’s classic Russian rhetoric that when something goes like bad in your country … blame somebody else, blame it on outside influences.”           Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky said the Dagestan riot signals that Russia is “losing control.”           Observers have also been quick to note that Putin’s expressed concern over civilian casualties in Gaza rings hollow.           His military continues a ruthless war against Ukraine, a campaign that has targeted civilian infrastructure and leveled cities, and the International Criminal Court (ICC) has issued an arrest warrant for the Russian president over his country’s conduct during the war.           But Putin is counting on a strategy that has already won dividends: Internationally, Moscow’s diplomats have been pressing a global PR offensive that casts Russia as a staunch anticolonial power, winning support in the Global South – even as it pursues a war of conquest in Ukraine.           Russian state media have echoed that narrative at home. Since the October 7 Hamas attacks on Israel, some Russian state TV commentators and politicians have ramped up their criticism of Israel, as the Gaza war conveniently distracts international attention from Ukraine.           Ukrainian Foreign Ministry spokesperson Oleh Nikolenko accused Moscow of trying to shift responsibility. “Threats to exterminate the Jews are the result of the work of Russian state propaganda, which for decades cultivated feelings of hatred towards other peoples among Russians,” he noted.           But as the riots in Dagestan showed, anti-Israel rhetoric can veer quickly off script.           Earlier this month, Ramzan Kadyrov, the pro-Kremlin warlord who rules the neighboring Russian republic of Chechnya, expressed “complete support” for Palestine and floated the notion of deploying his “peacemaking” forces to resolve the conflict between Israel and Hamas.           That may seem a farfetched idea – Kadyrov has an abysmal human rights-record – but for nearly two decades, the Chechen strongman has helped Putin keep a brutal, uneasy peace in Russia’s north Caucasus, a region that includes Dagestan. Kadyrov has also provided footsoldiers for Russia’s war in Ukraine.           So keeping the peace in Dagestan is likely focusing minds in the Kremlin. Protests erupted last year in the republic in response to the Russian government’s mobilization orders, with some activists complaining that ethnic minorities were being unfairly conscripted for service in Ukraine. The Gaza war adds one more match to the fire.           In a keenly observed commentary on Sunday’s events, Harold Chambers of the independent Russia-watching site Riddle Russia pointed to Dagestan’s dismal economic state and the Ukraine war as factors fuelling local grievance.           “The attempted pogrom is not just rooted in antisemitic messaging, but in systemic dynamics in the region,” he wrote.           “General socioeconomic conditions in the republic continue to deteriorate. Basic necessities to live such as electricity, water, and gas are irregularly supplied, which led to sustained small protests only a few months ago. Additionally, Russia’s war in Ukraine has impacted Dagestan heavily, with significant casualties. Public appeals and small actions do not regularly succeed, with the authorities sweeping them aside.”           Russian investigative journalist Yevgenia Albats was equally cutting in her analysis.           “Are there anti-Semites in Makhachkala?” she wrote on X. “Yes, sure. Have they been there before? Yes, sure. What has happened now? 20 months of war, rising prices, hundreds, if not thousands of men killed, the pressure is accumulating and requires a release.”           Russia’s information campaign, she added, is a convenient tool, presenting “a picture for the Middle East, Iran, for the Global South: Russia is with you, Putin is the leader of the anti-American world.”           Putin has for months played a risky geopolitical game, gambling on anti-Western distrust to shore up support for his war on Ukraine. But an anti-Jewish riot in the southern region of Dagestan shows how quickly that model can backfire, particularly for those trapped inside the echo of Russian state propaganda.    © 2023 Cable News Network.

world,Ukrainian family of nine shot dead in their sleep in Russian-occupied Donetsk,https://edition.cnn.com/2023/10/31/europe/russia-ukraine-donetsk-volnovakha-family-killed-intl-hnk/index.html,"       A family of nine, including two young children, were found shot dead in their home in the Russian-occupied eastern Ukrainian town of Volnovakha in a slaying that has sparked outrage in Ukraine and triggered investigations by both nations.           Images from the Ukrainian Donetsk Region Prosecutor’s Office showed a horrific murder scene of multiple family members shot while in their beds, still tucked in each others arms, with blood spatters visible on the walls.           Ukraine alleges the family were slain by Russian occupying forces following an argument, while Russian authorities say two Russian soldiers have been arrested over the killings.           Volnovakha has been occupied by Russian forces since March 2022 following Moscow’s brutal invasion of its neighbor the month before.           The Ukrainian Donetsk Region Prosecutor’s Office said armed men in “military uniform demanded that the family living there vacate the house to accommodate a Russian army unit” earlier this month.           When the owner of the house refused, “the attackers threatened his family members with physical violence and left,” the office said Monday, based on preliminary information.           Days later, gunmen returned and “shot all nine members of the family, who were already asleep at that time,” the Ukrainian prosecutor’s office said.           “A pre-trial investigation was initiated in criminal proceedings over violation of the laws and customs of war,” it said.           Russian investigators said two Russian servicemen were detained on Monday in connection with the murder of nine people in Volnovakha.           The suspects identified are “Russian military servicemen from the Far East serving under contract,” the Investigative Committee of the Russian Federation for the so-called Donetsk People’s Republic said in a statement.           An investigation was launched in connection with the “murder of nine residents of the town of Volnovakha, including two children, whose bodies were found in the premises of a private residential house with gunshot wounds” on October 28, the committee said.           Russian investigators said the initial assessment for “the motive of the crime was a conflict on domestic grounds.”           “The suspects were detained and taken to the investigative department, investigative and procedural actions aimed at establishing all the circumstances of the incident, as well as consolidation of the evidence base are being carried out with them,” the committee said.           This month, Ukrainian forces have held out against a renewed Russian offensive in eastern Ukraine, as Moscow’s forces pummel residential areas.

world,Polish archaeologists find remains of 17th-century woman and child padlocked in their graves,https://edition.cnn.com/2023/10/30/europe/padlocked-skeletons-archaeologists-poland-intl-scli-scn/index.html,"       Archaeologists in Poland have uncovered the remains of a 17th-century child padlocked to his grave to stop him rising from the dead, a discovery that turns the spotlight on beliefs in vampires as Halloween approaches.           The bones of the 6- or 7-year-old are the most recent find in a cemetery in the northern Polish village of Pien dating from an era that viewed ghosts, zombies and other supernatural apparitions as more than merely fancy dress options.           A woman’s body was also found in the cemetery with a padlock on her leg and a sickle around the neck, suggesting she was believed to be a vampire.           “This is a cemetery for rejected people, who were certainly feared after death, and perhaps also during life … who were suspected of having contacts with unclean forces, people who also behaved differently in some way,” said Dariusz Polinski, a researcher on medieval burials at Nicolaus Copernicus University in the city of Toruń.           The child was buried facedown with a triangular iron padlock under its foot, in a probable effort to keep it from sitting up and leaving the grave to feast on the living, he added.           “These are people who, if it was done intentionally, were afraid of … contact with these people because they might bite, drink blood,” Polinski said.           The child’s grave was desecrated at some point after burial and all bones removed apart from those in the legs.           Archaeologists have found other methods used to stop the living dead, with Polinski describing strange practices found in some burials.           “There were also a large number of graves with stones … which were also supposed to protect against the deceased, placed in various places, for example on the elbow, on the larynx or on the neck.”    © 2023 Cable News Network.

world,Antisemitic mob storms through Russian airport as flight from Tel Aviv lands,https://edition.cnn.com/2023/10/30/europe/russia-dagestan-airport-anti-israel-intl-hnk/index.html,"       An angry crowd in Russia’s mostly Muslim region of Dagestan stormed an airport where a flight from Israel arrived on Sunday, forcing authorities to close the facility and divert flights.           Multiple videos posted on social media showed a crowd of people inside the Makhachkala Uytash Airport (MCX) and on the runway, some waving the Palestinian flag, others forcing their way through closed doors in the international terminal.           In photos and videos verified by CNN, the crowd outside the airport held antisemitic signs that included slogans such as “We are against Jewish refugees,” and “There is no place for child-killers in Dagestan.”           Clashes left at least 10 people injured, including two people in critical condition, according to a statement by the Dagestan Health Ministry late Sunday.           The airport was temporarily closed and flights were diverted, according to a statement from the Russian Federal Air Transport Agency, saying “unknown persons” broke into the facility.           The Red Wing Airlines flight from Tel Aviv arrived Sunday at 7:17 p.m. local time, according to Flight Aware, and was quickly surrounded by protesters upon landing.           In one video, a pilot takes to the speaker of his aircraft to say: “It is not safe to open the doors” because “protesters are below our plane.”           According to Russian state media TASS, “those gathered oppose the Palestinian-Israeli conflict.”           On Sunday Ovadya Isakov, a local representative of the Jewish community, told Russian independent media outlet Podyom that “Israel has lost the information war.”           “The situation is very difficult in Dagestan, people from the community are afraid, they are calling but I don’t know what to advise,” Isakov told the media outlet.           The airport resumed operations on Monday, it said in a statement, while the Kremlin sought to place blame on “external interference.”           Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov said Russian President Vladimir Putin has been receiving extensive updates on the situation in Dagestan from various security agencies and local authorities, and has scheduled an extensive meeting for Monday evening to address the riots and alleged Western influence.           The Russian Jewish community called for strict punishment of the perpetrators and urged for responsible media coverage of Middle East events to prevent radicalization.           “The conflict in the Middle East has already affected the lives of people in Russia and that anti-Israeli sentiment has now turned into open aggression towards even Russian Jews,” Rabbi Alexander Boroda, head of the Federation of Jewish Communities of Russia, said in a statement provided to CNN.           “We see that local authorities were not prepared for such incidents and allowed large-scale violations of law and order, mass demonstrations with open threats to Jews and Israelis who could end up at the Makhachkala airport,” Boroda said.           The Chief Rabbi of Russia, Berel Lazar, meanwhile warned that “rabid propaganda of extremism and terror” is spreading on social media across Russia, citing both the airport mob and a fire at a Jewish Cultural Center in Nalchik, south-west Russia on Sunday.           The incident is the latest to illustrate huge global tensions and divides over the ongoing Israel-Hamas war, which was sparked by a coordinated October 7 attack by the militant group that killed some 1,400 people, mostly civilians, and the kidnapping of more than 200 people.     Israel’s retaliation has been relentless, with Gaza under siege and heavily bombarded, inflaming tensions far beyond the Middle East.           Israeli strikes on Gaza have resulted in some 8,000 fatalities, the Palestinian Ministry of Health in Ramallah said on Sunday, drawing the data from sources in the Hamas-controlled enclave. Around 3,000 of those killed are children, according to the same authorities.           Protests have erupted across the world, in support of both Israel and Gaza, with tensions often spilling over.           “Israel expects the Russian legal authorities to safeguard the well-being of all Israeli citizens and Jews wherever they are and to take strong action against the rioters and against the wild incitement being directed against Jews and Israelis,” the Israeli Prime Minister’s office and the Ministry of Foreign Affairs said in a joint statement.           “Israeli Ambassador to Russia Alex Ben Zvi is working with the Russian authorities to secure the well-being of Jews and Israelis at the site,” it added.           The US also called on Russia to protect Israelis and Jews.           “The United States vigorously condemns the antisemitic protests in Dagestan, Russia,” National Security Council spokeswoman Adrienne Watson wrote on social media.           “The US unequivocally stands with the entire Jewish community as we witness a worldwide surge in antisemitism. There is never any excuse or justification for antisemitism.”           In another post on social media, the US Special Envoy to Monitor and Combat Antisemitism, Amb. Deborah E. Lipstadt, condemned the incident.           “We condemn the violent protests that have been reported in Russia threatening Israelis and Jews. We call on Russian authorities to ensure their safety,” Lipstadt said.           Sergey Melikov, head of the Dagestan Republic, took to Telegram Sunday to denounce the incident, telling people to not spread false information or make hasty decisions.           “By your poorly thought-out actions you only aggravate the situation, pleasing the scoundrels who want to exploit the desire to see justice and the impassioned attitude to other people’s grief and unity, which have always distinguished Dagestanis,” Melikov said.

world,‘Parasites’: Mother wins court case to evict two sons in their 40s,https://edition.cnn.com/2023/10/27/europe/mum-evicts-sons-court-italy-intl-scli/index.html,"       A mother’s love does have limits, it seems. At least for a 75-year-old woman in the northern Italian city of Pavia who won a court order after suing to have her sons, aged 40 and 42, removed from her house, a court clerk in Pavia told CNN Friday.           The two sons, described in court papers by their mother as “parasites,” had been living in the family apartment without contributing financially or helping around the house, according to the complaint filed by the woman, who has not been named, in a the Tribunal of Pavia district court. Both men are employed, the court documents state.           Judge Simona Caterbi sided with the retired mother, who is separated from the men’s father and whose pension went entirely on food and maintenance of the home, ruling that the two “bamboccioni,” or big babies, have until December 18 to vacate the premises, according to Tuesday’s court ruling, seen by CNN.           Caterbi wrote: “There is no provision in the legislation which attributes to the adult child the unconditional right to remain in the home exclusively owned by the parents, against their will and by virtue of the family bond alone.”           The men, who hired lawyers to fight the maternal eviction, according to the local newspaper La Provincia Pavese, argued that Italian parents are required by law to take care of their children as long as necessary.           Caterbi cited the existing law in her ruling and agreed that “the stay in the property could initially be considered well founded because the law is based on the maintenance obligation incumbent on the parent.”           She then ruled that “it no longer appears justifiable considering the two defendants are subjects over 40 and once a certain age has been exceeded, the child can no longer expect the parents to continue the maintenance obligation beyond limits that are no longer reasonable.”     Texan-turned-Italian princess evicted from villa with original Caravaggio in Rome         A lawyer for the men told local media that the men had not decided if they would appeal the court decision.           This is not the first time “mammoni,” an Italian term used to describe adult men who are too dependent on their mothers, has cropped up in the legal system.           In 2020, Italy’s Supreme Court ruled against a 35-year-old man who worked as a part-time music teacher who still expected financial support from his parents after he argued that he could not support himself on an annual salary of 20,000 euros ($21,100).           On average, Italians leave their parental home at the average age of 30, according to Eurostat 2022 data. Croatia is the highest in the European Union, with an average age of 33.4 years. By contrast, offspring in Finland, Sweden and Denmark start life on their own at the average age of 21, according to the same data.    © 2023 Cable News Network. A Warner Bros. Discovery Company.

world,King Charles III will confront Britain’s colonial past when he visits Kenya,https://edition.cnn.com/2023/10/27/uk/royal-news-newsletter-kenya-visit-scli-gbr-cmd-intl/index.html," Editor’s Note: This is a version of CNN’s Royal News, a weekly dispatch bringing you the inside track on Britain’s royal family. Sign up here.         When King Charles III visits Kenya next week, he’ll do something no other member of his family has done in the country.           That’s because, in addition to the usual fare of state banquets and such, he’s planning on acknowledging the “more painful aspects” of shared history between the United Kingdom and Kenya, according to Buckingham Palace.           The four-day visit starts Tuesday and comes as the country prepares to celebrate 60 years of independence from Britain. Charles will be joined by his wife, Queen Camilla.           The Mau Mau uprising – a violent period in which thousands were killed - pushed Kenya toward independence in 1963. It is seen as one of the most brutal episodes of Britain’s imperial past.           The rebellion against British colonialists in Kenya in the 1950s originated from the Kikuyu tribe, the country’s largest ethnic group. As the empire struggled to quell the insurgency in one of its most important colonies, it declared a “state of emergency” and detained as many as 160,000 Kenyans.           It’s also estimated some 90,000 people in custody were tortured, maimed or killed, according to the Kenyan Human Rights Commission. The conditions were so bad that even Britain’s colonial-era attorney-general likened the detention of thousands in the squalid camps to Nazi Germany.           Next week’s royal visit will largely focus on the strong connection between the two countries.           Chris Fitzgerald, the King’s deputy private secretary, said next week’s trip would “celebrate the close links between the British and Kenyan people in areas such as the creative arts, technology, enterprise, education, and innovation.”           He added: “The visit will also acknowledge the more painful aspects of the UK and Kenya’s shared history, including the Emergency… His Majesty will take time during the visit to deepen his understanding of the wrongs suffered in this period by the people of Kenya.”           Days before the royal visit, elders of the Nandi community called for the UK to return the skull of a leader killed in 1905 by the British, Kenya’s The Nation newspaper reported. The skull of Koitalel arap Samoei is believed to be in a UK museum. The elders are also demanding the return of other stolen cultural artefacts as well as compensation for the atrocities that took place against the Nandi community during colonial rule, the local media outlet reported.           In 2013, following a years-long legal battle brought by a group of elderly Kenyans who said they were tortured during Britain’s rule, then-Foreign Secretary William Hague announced a £19.9 million (around $30 million) settlement between the British Government and more than 5,000 Kenyan claimants over human rights abuses, along with the construction of a memorial for victims of torture.           “The British government sincerely regrets that these abuses took place and that they marred Kenya’s progress towards independence. Torture and ill-treatment are abhorrent violations of human dignity which we unreservedly condemn,” Hague said in a statement to the UK Parliament.           While the settlement recognized the suffering and injustice of the period, it fell short of accepting responsibility. “We continue to deny liability on behalf of the Government and British taxpayers today for the actions of the colonial administration in respect of the claims,” Hague added.           Ten years on, Charles will be greeted with a formal reception at the State House in Nairobi. He will engage in bilateral discussions with President William Ruto and other Kenyan government officials and participate in meetings with faith leaders, young individuals and entrepreneurs during his visit.           The trip also marks his first to a Commonwealth member nation during his reign.           Charles succeeded his mother as head of the organization – an association of independent states that emerged out of the ashes of the British Empire. Since 1969, Charles has visited 48 of the 56 Commonwealth countries, most recently Rwanda last year for the Commonwealth Heads of Government Meeting (CHOGM).           While there, Charles recognized that “the roots of our contemporary association run deep into the most painful period of our history” and spoke of his “personal sorrow at the suffering of so many, as I continue to deepen my own understanding of slavery’s enduring impact.”           He followed up those words this year when he expressed his support for research into the royal family’s historical involvement in the slave trade.     Kenya holds a special place for the British royal family. In 1952, then-Princess Elizabeth was staying at Treetops Lodge in the Aberdares mountains when she found out her father had died, and she was to become Queen. Unfortunately, King Charles’ jam-packed schedule during the trip will not permit him to visit the poignant location.    © 2023 Cable News Network. A Warner Bros. Discovery Company.

world,CNN,https://edition.cnn.com/2023/11/06/middleeast/gaza-workers-allege-abuse/index.html," Editor’s note: The interviews with Gazan workers in this story were conducted by Hassan Eslayeh, a freelance journalist with whom the network has severed ties. Other journalists interviewed the same group of workers. CNN is reviewing this material.         Palestinian workers who were expelled back to Gaza from Israel last week have accused Israeli authorities of “torture,” alleging they were stripped naked, held in cages, viciously beaten and, according to one worker’s account, subjected to electric shocks.           “They broke us and beat us with batons and metal sticks… they humiliated us… they have made us starve without food or water,” Muqbel Abdullah Al Radia, another of the workers, told CNN.           CNN spoke to Abdullah Al Radia and eight other men who returned to Gaza through the Kerem Shalom crossing in southern Israel on Friday. Al Radia, who is from Beit Lahiya, a village in northern Gaza, told CNN he was working in Israel  – one of thousands of Palestinians from Gaza with permits to do so – when the war started.           Most workers from Gaza work in construction or agriculture. They tend to spend weeks away from home, rather than commuting, which is why so many were in Israel when Hamas launched its terror attack on Saturday October 7.           Al Radia said that right after the war started, he and some of the other Gazan workers fled to Rahat, a predominantly Arab Bedouin city in southern Israel, where he says they were turned over to the Israeli army by local residents.           “(The military) took our phones and money, we couldn’t communicate with our families, we were given food on the floor in plastic bags,” he said.           When the October 7 Hamas attack on Israel was first launched, Israeli media reported of initial fears that Hamas militants were among the workers with permits, although an Israeli security official later told CNN the men were detained for being in Israel illegally after their work permits were revoked, not for suspected terror activity.           The security official said that in some cases, their detention was also for their own protection, as they were at risk of violence from Israeli communities.           Six human rights organizations in Israel have filed a petition to Israel’s High Court arguing these detentions were “without legal authority and without legal grounds.”           Gisha, an Israeli not-for-profit organization focused on protecting the freedom of movement of Palestinians and one of the groups behind the petition, said in a statement last week that it had “reason to believe that the holding conditions in these facilities were extremely dire, and that detainees were subjected to extensive physical violence and psychological abuse, as well as being held in inhumane conditions.”           Many of the workers say they had no idea where they were taken. According to the Palestinian Prisoners Society, a human rights organization based in the occupied West Bank, many were held in two detention centers: one in Ofer near Ramallah and one in Salem near Jenin.           Another worker from Beit Lahiya, Mahmoud Abu Darabeh, also described beatings by what he says were Israeli forces.           Abu Darabeh said he was detained on the second day of the war. “They put us in cages like dogs, beatings, insults, they didn’t care whether people are ill or not, some of us were injured, their feet got rotten because they didn’t get any medical treatment,” he said.           The men faced daily interrogations from the Israeli authorities asking about their homes and family members, Abu Darabeh said.           “If you happen to have a relative that is a police officer of Hamas you get beaten. I know people whose rib cage was completely broken, some people died of torture,” he told CNN.           He also described how some of the workers died during detention and while crossing into Gaza.           “Some people died on the way here because they were beaten and subjected to electric shocks,” Abu Darabeh said. He said he personally witnessed others who were detained with him being shocked.           An Israeli security official told CNN that the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) was aware of several incidents of “abuse” of Gazan workers by IDF soldiers.           “There have been cases of abuse towards the detainees outside of the official detention facilities. These cases were treated very seriously, and they were dealt with disciplinary measures,” the official said through a translator, saying that to their knowledge, four soldiers were removed from the IDF following incidents of abuse and two soldiers were put in military prison for their conduct.           When asked if any of the detainees died as a result of abuse, the official said that they were aware of two deaths of Gazan workers who were detained, but said these deaths were the result of chronic, long-term health issues these workers had before entering Israel, not the result of abuse.           The official said that, to his knowledge, these abuses did not include electric shocks.           CNN has reviewed some of the videos showing the alleged abuses and cannot independently verify them. They show people being detained, with their hands and feet tied, sitting in the sun, and being kicked and dragged around. One video shows a bus full of people who have been blindfolded, their hands tied.           The security official who spoke to CNN about these allegations said the IDF was investigating these videos and confirmed two – one showing IDF soldiers kicking a detained person and one showing a large group of detainees tied, blindfolded and humiliated – were genuine. The official said soldiers who took part in these videos were punished by the IDF.           “The conduct of the force that emerges from the footage is deplorable and does not comply with the army’s orders,” the IDF said in a statement emailed to CNN. It added that several soldiers and reserve soldiers shown in some of these videos have been suspended.           The men CNN spoke to were among thousands of laborers from the Gaza Strip who were working in Israel with special permits when Hamas launched its brutal terror attack on the country, killing 1,400 people and kidnapping about 240.           In response to the attacks, Israel began an unrelenting bombing campaign on Gaza, while the country’s defense minister Yoav Gallant ordered a “complete siege” on the enclave.     In Gaza, being a mother is a matter of life and death         Before the October 7 attacks, about 18,000 Gazans had permits that allowed them to cross into Israel for work – where wages can be as much as ten times higher than in Gaza.           All of them would have been subjected to a rigorous security clearing process by the Israeli authorities before being issued the permit.           Immediately after the attack, Israel also revoked the Gazan workers’ permits, which made it illegal for them to stay in the country. Since returning to Gaza was not a possibility, many tried to flee to the occupied West Bank.           “They suspended our permissions, we tried to go to the West Bank, they detained us and put us in places where we never knew where we were,” one of the workers told CNN adding: “They tied our arms, blindfolded us, and put us on buses, they were gathering 200 to 300 of us between metal fences, beating and investigating us day and night,” one man, who didn’t disclose his name, told CNN.           Several of the workers told CNN they were blindfolded and handcuffed for long periods of time. Some said they were held in a fenced-off area outside, which they said meant it was boiling hot during the day and very cold at night.           The security official said that at the beginning, some of the facilities didn’t have shade, but added this was rectified within a few days. The official said detainees were only restrained when in transit.           When crossing into Gaza on Friday, many of the men appeared deeply emotional. When interviewed by CNN, most were too scared to share their personal details, fearing persecution.           One man, from the Al-Maghazi refugee camp, sobbed as he described how they were packed into metal cages and deprived of sleep, a known form of torture.           “Every now and then, they came to us and asked us to stand up. Stand up, sit down, stand up, sit down, stand up,” he said. “In one place, we were around 150 people in a metal cage. It smelled very bad, I think it was used for chickens or rabbits before,” he added.           Another worker from Al-Zaytun Quarter in Gaza City also told CNN he and other detainees were made to stand up and sit down repeatedly.           “They beat us and stole our money, and they took our clothes off and kept us naked,           I was only in my underwear for more than 20 days,” he said.           Amani Sarahneh, spokesperson for the Palestinian Prisoners Society, said some of these men were detained on the way to the West Bank while some were detained in the West Bank.           The men tried to reach the occupied West Bank because once Israel revoked their permits, they were in legal limbo – their stay in Israel became illegal, but there was no clear way back to Gaza with border crossings on both the Israeli and Egyptian side closed. While they also need permits for the West Bank, it was safer for them to be in a territory that is under Palestinian control, they believed.     More than 10,000 killed in Gaza, Hamas-controlled health ministry says, as condemnation of Israel’s campaign grows         Sarahneh told CNN the organization does not know how many men were held despite repeated attempts to get information from the Israeli authorities.           Sarahneh told CNN many of the workers recounted similar experiences.           “Most of the testimonies were about being starved, being continuously beaten during the day, handcuffed, isolated from their surroundings,” she said, adding that videos showing Palestinian prisoners being treated violently and in an inhumane manner have surfaced online.           “They didn’t do anything wrong; they were not charged with anything … yet many of them were interrogated and systematically tortured, abused, brutally beaten, they faced all kind of dehumanization and insults,” she added.           Dror Sadot, a spokesperson for B’Tselem, the Israeli Information Center for Human Rights in the Occupied Territories, an NGO, said the October 7 attacks by Hamas have led to a huge spike of aggression towards Palestinians.           She told CNN “the dehumanization of Palestinians is coming from the very top,” with public figures referring to Palestinians “not as human beings.”           She said that this rhetoric and the anger over the crimes of Hamas trickles down to the individual soldiers, who then treat any Palestinian with rage.           Sadot said that long-term experience with the way the IDF generally handles cases of abuse is not convincing.           “We’ve been investigating this for so many years – the military enforcement system works as a whitewash mechanism with almost no indictments,” she said.  “So they will say ‘those are the exception, not the rule,’ but if the impunity for soldiers continues – and not just the soldiers but also the policy itself – when no one’s being held accountable, of course, things will just continue,” she added.           CNN footage of the workers crossing into Gaza on Friday, the first time any of them were allowed in, shows dozens of men walking into the enclave on foot.           Some are elderly, visibly exhausted, and drenched in sweat, while others appear to be injured.           At least three have deep, visible cuts on their wrists which appear to have been caused by hand ties.           Most of the men are not carrying any personal belongings apart from the clothes they are wearing.           One man, 58-year-old Mohamed Atallah, was wearing a plastic number tag on his wrist.           He showed CNN a prison inventory of his confiscated belongings which he said were never returned.           Some of the workers returning to Gaza on Friday told CNN the Israeli authorities loaded them onto buses which took them to the crossing into Gaza, where they’d been dropped off.           They were then forced to walk for “about three hours” to cross into the enclave, several of them told CNN.           Once they entered the Gaza Strip, some of the workers fell on their knees and started to pray, the CNN footage shows.           They touched the ground with their foreheads, thanking God to be back in Gaza – the place that has become a hell on earth since they last left it.           “We were dying, I swear. Every day was like a death sentence,” Bilal Aysha told CNN. “Thank God I am back here. May God make everyone happy again,” he said.    © 2023 Cable News Network. A Warner Bros. Discovery Company.

Al Radia said that right after the war started, he and some of the other Gazan workers fled to Rahat, a predominantly Arab Bedouin city in southern Israel, where he says they were turned over to the Israeli army by local residents.           “(The military) took our phones and money, we couldn’t communicate with our families, we were given food on the floor in plastic bags,” he said.           When the October 7 Hamas attack on Israel was first launched, Israeli media reported of initial fears that Hamas militants were among the workers with permits, although an Israeli security official later told CNN the men were detained for being in Israel illegally after their work permits were revoked, not for suspected terror activity.           The security official said that in some cases, their detention was also for their own protection, as they were at risk of violence from Israeli communities.           Six human rights organizations in Israel have filed a petition to Israel’s High Court arguing these detentions were “without legal authority and without legal grounds.”           Gisha, an Israeli not-for-profit organization focused on protecting the freedom of movement of Palestinians and one of the groups behind the petition, said in a statement last week that it had “reason to believe that the holding conditions in these facilities were extremely dire, and that detainees were subjected to extensive physical violence and psychological abuse, as well as being held in inhumane conditions.”           Many of the workers say they had no idea where they were taken. According to the Palestinian Prisoners Society, a human rights organization based in the occupied West Bank, many were held in two detention centers: one in Ofer near Ramallah and one in Salem near Jenin.           Another worker from Beit Lahiya, Mahmoud Abu Darabeh, also described beatings by what he says were Israeli forces.           Abu Darabeh said he was detained on the second day of the war. “They put us in cages like dogs, beatings, insults, they didn’t care whether people are ill or not, some of us were injured, their feet got rotten because they didn’t get any medical treatment,” he said.           The men faced daily interrogations from the Israeli authorities asking about their homes and family members, Abu Darabeh said.           “If you happen to have a relative that is a police officer of Hamas you get beaten. I know people whose rib cage was completely broken, some people died of torture,” he told CNN.           He also described how some of the workers died during detention and while crossing into Gaza.           “Some people died on the way here because they were beaten and subjected to electric shocks,” Abu Darabeh said. He said he personally witnessed others who were detained with him being shocked.           An Israeli security official told CNN that the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) was aware of several incidents of “abuse” of Gazan workers by IDF soldiers.           “There have been cases of abuse towards the detainees outside of the official detention facilities. These cases were treated very seriously, and they were dealt with disciplinary measures,” the official said through a translator, saying that to their knowledge, four soldiers were removed from the IDF following incidents of abuse and two soldiers were put in military prison for their conduct.           When asked if any of the detainees died as a result of abuse, the official said that they were aware of two deaths of Gazan workers who were detained, but said these deaths were the result of chronic, long-term health issues these workers had before entering Israel, not the result of abuse.           The official said that, to his knowledge, these abuses did not include electric shocks.           CNN has reviewed some of the videos showing the alleged abuses and cannot independently verify them. They show people being detained, with their hands and feet tied, sitting in the sun, and being kicked and dragged around. One video shows a bus full of people who have been blindfolded, their hands tied.           The security official who spoke to CNN about these allegations said the IDF was investigating these videos and confirmed two – one showing IDF soldiers kicking a detained person and one showing a large group of detainees tied, blindfolded and humiliated – were genuine. The official said soldiers who took part in these videos were punished by the IDF.           “The conduct of the force that emerges from the footage is deplorable and does not comply with the army’s orders,” the IDF said in a statement emailed to CNN. It added that several soldiers and reserve soldiers shown in some of these videos have been suspended.           The men CNN spoke to were among thousands of laborers from the Gaza Strip who were working in Israel with special permits when Hamas launched its brutal terror attack on the country, killing 1,400 people and kidnapping about 240.           In response to the attacks, Israel began an unrelenting bombing campaign on Gaza, while the country’s defense minister Yoav Gallant ordered a “complete siege” on the enclave.     In Gaza, being a mother is a matter of life and death         Before the October 7 attacks, about 18,000 Gazans had permits that allowed them to cross into Israel for work – where wages can be as much as ten times higher than in Gaza.           All of them would have been subjected to a rigorous security clearing process by the Israeli authorities before being issued the permit.           Immediately after the attack, Israel also revoked the Gazan workers’ permits, which made it illegal for them to stay in the country. Since returning to Gaza was not a possibility, many tried to flee to the occupied West Bank.           “They suspended our permissions, we tried to go to the West Bank, they detained us and put us in places where we never knew where we were,” one of the workers told CNN adding: “They tied our arms, blindfolded us, and put us on buses, they were gathering 200 to 300 of us between metal fences, beating and investigating us day and night,” one man, who didn’t disclose his name, told CNN.           Several of the workers told CNN they were blindfolded and handcuffed for long periods of time. Some said they were held in a fenced-off area outside, which they said meant it was boiling hot during the day and very cold at night.           The security official said that at the beginning, some of the facilities didn’t have shade, but added this was rectified within a few days. The official said detainees were only restrained when in transit.           When crossing into Gaza on Friday, many of the men appeared deeply emotional. When interviewed by CNN, most were too scared to share their personal details, fearing persecution.           One man, from the Al-Maghazi refugee camp, sobbed as he described how they were packed into metal cages and deprived of sleep, a known form of torture.           “Every now and then, they came to us and asked us to stand up. Stand up, sit down, stand up, sit down, stand up,” he said. “In one place, we were around 150 people in a metal cage. It smelled very bad, I think it was used for chickens or rabbits before,” he added.           Another worker from Al-Zaytun Quarter in Gaza City also told CNN he and other detainees were made to stand up and sit down repeatedly.           “They beat us and stole our money, and they took our clothes off and kept us naked,           I was only in my underwear for more than 20 days,” he said.           Amani Sarahneh, spokesperson for the Palestinian Prisoners Society, said some of these men were detained on the way to the West Bank while some were detained in the West Bank.           The men tried to reach the occupied West Bank because once Israel revoked their permits, they were in legal limbo – their stay in Israel became illegal, but there was no clear way back to Gaza with border crossings on both the Israeli and Egyptian side closed. While they also need permits for the West Bank, it was safer for them to be in a territory that is under Palestinian control, they believed.     More than 10,000 killed in Gaza, Hamas-controlled health ministry says, as condemnation of Israel’s campaign grows         Sarahneh told CNN the organization does not know how many men were held despite repeated attempts to get information from the Israeli authorities.           Sarahneh told CNN many of the workers recounted similar experiences.           “Most of the testimonies were about being starved, being continuously beaten during the day, handcuffed, isolated from their surroundings,” she said, adding that videos showing Palestinian prisoners being treated violently and in an inhumane manner have surfaced online.           “They didn’t do anything wrong; they were not charged with anything … yet many of them were interrogated and systematically tortured, abused, brutally beaten, they faced all kind of dehumanization and insults,” she added.           Dror Sadot, a spokesperson for B’Tselem, the Israeli Information Center for Human Rights in the Occupied Territories, an NGO, said the October 7 attacks by Hamas have led to a huge spike of aggression towards Palestinians.           She told CNN “the dehumanization of Palestinians is coming from the very top,” with public figures referring to Palestinians “not as human beings.”           She said that this rhetoric and the anger over the crimes of Hamas trickles down to the individual soldiers, who then treat any Palestinian with rage.           Sadot said that long-term experience with the way the IDF generally handles cases of abuse is not convincing.           “We’ve been investigating this for so many years – the military enforcement system works as a whitewash mechanism with almost no indictments,” she said.  “So they will say ‘those are the exception, not the rule,’ but if the impunity for soldiers continues – and not just the soldiers but also the policy itself – when no one’s being held accountable, of course, things will just continue,” she added.           CNN footage of the workers crossing into Gaza on Friday, the first time any of them were allowed in, shows dozens of men walking into the enclave on foot.           Some are elderly, visibly exhausted, and drenched in sweat, while others appear to be injured.           At least three have deep, visible cuts on their wrists which appear to have been caused by hand ties.           Most of the men are not carrying any personal belongings apart from the clothes they are wearing.           One man, 58-year-old Mohamed Atallah, was wearing a plastic number tag on his wrist.           He showed CNN a prison inventory of his confiscated belongings which he said were never returned.           Some of the workers returning to Gaza on Friday told CNN the Israeli authorities loaded them onto buses which took them to the crossing into Gaza, where they’d been dropped off.           They were then forced to walk for “about three hours” to cross into the enclave, several of them told CNN.           Once they entered the Gaza Strip, some of the workers fell on their knees and started to pray, the CNN footage shows.           They touched the ground with their foreheads, thanking God to be back in Gaza – the place that has become a hell on earth since they last left it.           “We were dying, I swear. Every day was like a death sentence,” Bilal Aysha told CNN. “Thank God I am back here. May God make everyone happy again,” he said.    © 2023 Cable News Network. A Warner Bros. Discovery Company.

world,"This Palestinian girl went from wearing a sparkly tiara to bandages. Even in her hospital bed, she may not be safe",https://edition.cnn.com/2023/10/30/middleeast/gaza-israel-bombardment-children-humanitarian-crisis-intl/index.html," Editor’s note: CNN has removed quotes from an interview conducted for this story by Hassan Eslayeh, a freelance journalist with whom the network has severed ties.         Three-year-old Joudi hasn’t uttered a word in 16 days, her father says. Wearing a gray dress adorned with a picture of an ice cream cone, she stares ahead, a vacant look in her eyes, while sitting in bed at al-Shifa Hospital in Gaza City.           Her forehead is wrapped in bandages, a piece of shrapnel still lodged in her head.           She was injured when her family was fleeing their home in Al Karama Towers in northern Gaza City. They were trying to get to the Sheikh Radwan neighborhood, believing they would be safer there, when an airstrike hit a car next to theirs.           Gaza, the Palestinian enclave of more than 2 million people, has been under bombardment by the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) for more than three weeks, following the gruesome October 7 terrorist attacks in Israel by Hamas, the militant group that governs the territory.           More than 1,400 Israelis and foreigners, including dozens of children, were killed in that attack, with over 220 others taken hostage, according to Israeli authorities.           The civilian death toll from the ensuing Israeli airstrikes, which the IDF says are targeting Hamas, has been enormous.           Nearly 8,000 Palestinians, including around 3,300 children, have been killed so far, according to the Hamas-controlled Ministry of Health in Ramallah, which compiles figures from Gaza.           Save the Children, working off those numbers, says more children have been killed in the last three weeks in Gaza than during armed conflict worldwide each year since 2019.           More than 20,000 people are injured, according to the Palestinian Ministry of Health in Ramallah.           The IDF has told civilians to leave northern Gaza, where much of the strikes are focused, and flee south. But not everyone is in a position to leave and the journey is dangerous, especially with Israeli bombardment in parts of the south as well as the north.           On Sunday, UNRWA, the United Nations relief agency that works with Palestinian refugees, said “thousands” of desperate people breached its warehouses and took basic items, including wheat, flour and hygiene products.           A warehouse in Deir al-Balah was one of those breached, UNRWA said.           “This is a worrying sign that civil order is starting to break down after three weeks of war and a tight siege on Gaza. People are scared, frustrated and desperate,” said Thomas White, director of UNRWA Affairs in Gaza.           He said that aid currently allowed into Gaza does not cover the basic needs of the communities that are fighting for survival.           The Palestinian Red Crescent said on Sunday that only 118 trucks loaded with supplies have reached Gaza since some aid was allowed through the Rafah border crossing with Egypt last week – the only way into the enclave at the moment.           Another 59 trucks arrived at the border on Monday morning.           But that amount is a drop in the ocean, aid groups say.           The UN said 455 trucks used to come to Gaza each day before the war. The IDF said Sunday that it expects more aid trucks to begin entering Gaza soon, and denied that there were shortages of food, water or medicine, despite the complete closure Israel imposed on the territory in response to the October 7 Hamas attack on Israel.           “We have established a joint mechanism with the U.N., the U.S. and Egypt to facilitate the access of humanitarian assistance from Egypt to Gaza,” Elad Goren, Head of Civil Affairs Department for COGAT (Coordinator of Government Activities in the Territories), said in a briefing, adding: “We have a lot of concerns about what is on those trucks so we are inspecting…We will see more trucks and the amount will be much higher in the next few days.”           The already grim humanitarian situation was made worse by a near-total communication blackout that started on Friday and lasted into Sunday morning           Ibrahim Dahman, CNN’s producer in Gaza, said people were struggling to reach their loved ones in the enclave.           “I cannot reach them and I don’t know anything about them,” Dahman said in one of several short voice recordings sent to CNN colleagues on Saturday. He was using a phone with a foreign SIM card, which allowed him intermittent connection via WhatsApp.           “Even if they were subjected to shelling, or to be killed or wounded, I wouldn’t know anything,” he said.           Dahman said on Monday that his parents were safe.           Meanwhile, people being treated at al-Shifa Hospital in Gaza City, including 3-year old Joudi, have found themselves facing more risk.           The IDF on Friday accused the hospital of being the site of a major Hamas command and control center. The IDF said Hamas was directing rocket attacks and commanding operations from bunkers underneath the hospital building – a claim Hamas has denied.           “When medical facilities are used for terror purposes, they are liable to lose their protection from attack in accordance with international law,” Hagari said in a briefing, appearing to suggest al-Shifa Hospital was on Israel’s target list.           Dr. Medhat Abbas, director general of the health ministry in Gaza, told CNN that its hospitals “are used to treat patients only” and are not being used “to hide anyone.”           For now, Joudi and hundreds of other injured children are staying put in the hospital.           Doctors are trying their best to save as many people as possible, but the conditions are getting more difficult by the hour. The hospital, designed for 700 patients, has been treating 5,000 people every day, according to local health authorities.           Patients are lying on the floors and in the corridors as more casualties flood the hospital, officials say and videos from the hospital show. Fuel shortages and the communications blackout are making the situation even worse.           Joudi’s family has a short video of her, filmed not too long ago. It shows her wearing a pink, princess-like dress and a sparkling tiara. She looks shy at first, then puts on a broad smile for whoever is behind the camera.           That smile is now just a memory, her tiara replaced by bandages. Still in shock, Joudi is refusing to eat or drink, her father told CNN. She barely moves, sitting still and looking into the distance. Doctors told the family Joudi is paralyzed. They couldn’t take the shrapnel out of her skull.       Mohammad Al Sawalhi reported from Gaza. Ivana Kottasová reported and wrote from Ashkelon, Israel.

world,"She fled the Israeli army as a young woman. Now in her 90s, she is running again",https://edition.cnn.com/2023/10/27/middleeast/israel-gaza-woman-flee-army-al-majdal-intl/index.html," Editor’s note: CNN has removed a photo and quotes from an interview conducted for this story by Hassan Eslayeh, a freelance journalist with whom the network has severed ties.         Souad Al-Alem was one of the roughly 10,000 people forced to flee the Palestinian town of al-Majdal. It was 1948, she was a young woman and Israel’s troops were approaching the community during the Arab-Israeli war in what is now part of the Israeli city of Ashkelon.           Now in her 90s and living in Gaza, Al-Alem has been forced to run again.           On October 7, Hamas launched a deadly terror attack against Israel from Gaza, firing thousands of rockets, going on a bloody rampage that killed 1,400 people and taking more than 220 hostage. In retaliation, the Israel Defence Forces have been conducting a massive bombardment campaign against what it says are Hamas targets in Gaza. More than 6,850 Palestinians have been killed as a result of these strikes, according to information from Hamas-controlled health authorities in Gaza and published by the Palestinian Ministry of Health in Ramallah.           Al-Alem is one of the hundreds of thousands of civilians caught up in the war.           “I see death 20 times every day, in the sky and on earth. Even the force of every blast affects us psychologically. It feels like it is on top of our heads when it’s next to us or nearby,” Al-Alem told CNN.           Just 10 miles north of the Gaza border, not much remains of al-Majdal. Once a buzzing market place known for textile manufacturing, al-Majdal was reduced to rubble after the 1948/49 war.           All of its houses are long gone, replaced with modern Israeli buildings that are now part of Ashkelon. Only the old mosque remains standing. Nearby, an empty, overgrown field gives a hint of the size of the former town.           Some 700,000 Palestinians were expelled or fled their homes following the 1948/49 war, representing at least 80 percent of Arabs living in what became Israel. Like Al-Alem, more than half of those who live in Gaza today are either refugees or their direct descendants.           Many of those displaced in 1948 thought that they’d be back home in a few days or weeks. But Israel has never allowed them to return and many have lived in poverty ever since. According to the UN Relief and Works Agency for Palestine Refugees in the Near East (UNRWA), more than 80% of people in Gaza live in poverty now.           Palestinians call that episode the Nakba, the Arabic word for catastrophe.           “I lived the Nakba of 1948 and now I am living the Nakba of 2023,” Al-Alem said, sitting in a tent in a makeshift refugee camp in Khan Younis in southern Gaza. “This second one is worse,” she added. She said she fled her home amid intense bombing more than 10 days ago and said she hasn’t had a proper meal or bath since then. As a diabetic, she said she was struggling without regular meals and access to her usual medication.           “There nothing to use for cleaning our faces and hands and ourselves. We can’t wash or do anything. There is nothing.  There were toilets, now there aren’t any. When we go to toilets, they are dirty because too many people are using them. I stopped going to them,” she said.           While most of the former Arab villages and towns are long gone, the collective memory lives on.           “It’s amazing how the Palestinians keep those memories alive. Most of them in the traditional way, from stories told by their fathers and grandfathers,” said Umar al-Ghubari, a Palestinian educator who works for Zochrot.           A Tel Aviv-based NGO, Zochrot was originally formed by a group of Israeli Jews with a goal to “promote acknowledgement, responsibility and accountability” for the ﻿emptied Palestinian villages and campaign for the right of return of these communities.     Before and after satellite images show destruction in Gaza         The first step is to spread awareness, al-Ghubari said. Zochrot operates in Hebrew, publishing information materials, organizing tours and collecting testimonies.           Al-Ghubari acknowledges that Zochrot’s work runs counter to the mainstream Israeli narrative, which tends to gloss over the issue of Palestinian expulsions during the war, preferring to highlight the contentious idea that the desert only started ‘blooming’ once Israel was founded.           Earlier this year, Israel and its allies including the United States and other Western nations skipped ﻿the first ever event at the United Nations marking the 75th anniversary of the Nakba – coinciding with the 75th anniversary of Israel’s founding.           The Israeli government rejects Nakba commemorations, with Israel’s Ambassador to the UN Gilad Erdan saying they “only serve to demonize Israel and further push away any chance for reconciliation.”           Al-Ghubari said that one of Zochrot’s missions is to make Israeli people more aware of the history, however uncomfortable it is.           But it’s hard going, he said. Zochrot has in the past tried to install information signs at the sites of the destroyed villages.           “We put signs up in these locations, but unfortunately, these signs would be removed almost immediately within few hours of few days because some Israelis when they come to that place, they don’t like the idea of that information being there,” he said. Al-Ghubari does not know who took the signs down.           Of the six sites of former villages visited by CNN earlier this week, none had any information about Palestinian villages on display.           Most people who live in Gaza today still identify as Palestinian refugees and refer to the towns and villages their ancestors were forced to flee as their homes – even if their families have now lived in the enclave for several generations.           In 1967, Israel captured Gaza during the Six-Day War with Egypt, Jordan and Syria, and held it for nearly 40 years before withdrawing troops and Israelis settlers in 2005.           After Hamas took power inside the enclave two years later, Israel and Egypt, which continued to have full control over entry and exit points to the enclave, including the sea, imposed a blockade that critics say transformed it into “the world’s largest open-air prison.”       CNN’s Celine Alkhaldi and Nada Bashir contributed reporting.  © 2023 Cable News Network.

world,"More than 10,000 killed in Gaza, Hamas-controlled health ministry says, as condemnation of Israel’s campaign grows",https://edition.cnn.com/2023/11/06/middleeast/gaza-10k-deaths-intl/index.html," Editor’s Note: CNN has removed a description in this story attributed to Hassan Eslayeh, a freelance journalist with whom the network has severed ties.         More than 10,000 people have been killed in Gaza since Israel launched its military offensive nearly a month ago, the Hamas-controlled health ministry in the Palestinian enclave said Monday.     Israel declared war on Hamas after the Islamist militant group launched a brutal attack on October 7, killing 1,400 in Israel and kidnapping more than 240. Israel retaliated by launching an air and ground offensive on Gaza, vowing to eliminate the militant group.           Ministry spokesperson Ashraf Al Qudra said 10,022 Palestinians in the enclave had been killed by Israeli strikes, including 4,104 children, 2,641 women and 611 elderly people. Those numbers suggest about three-quarters of the dead are from vulnerable populations. The ministry also reported 25,408 injured.           It’s unclear how many combatants are included in the total. CNN cannot independently verify the numbers released by the ministry in Gaza, which is sealed off by Israel and mostly sealed by Egypt.           On Monday alone, after a day of heavy Israeli bombardment, central Gaza’s Al-Aqsa Martyrs hospital saw over a hundred fatalities, according to the institution’s media office.           There have been “many, many thousands of innocent people killed” in Gaza, White House National Security Council coordinator for strategic communications John Kirby told reporters on a virtual gaggle Monday.           Thousands more Palestinians have been killed in Gaza in the last month than those who died in conflicts with Israel spanning over the last 15 years.           The United Nations Human Rights Office said last week’s attacks on Gaza’s largest refugee camp “could amount to war crimes” given the scale of casualties and destruction.           Israel has said that it is targeting Hamas operatives in Gaza, adding that Hamas “intentionally embeds its assets in civilian areas” and uses civilians as human shields, a defense echoed by US officials.           In an interview that aired on ABC News Monday, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said he expected Israel to have the “overall security responsibility” in Gaza for an “indefinite period” after the war ends.           “We’ve seen what happens when we don’t have it,” he continued.           On Monday, UN Secretary General António Guterres warned that Gaza is “becoming a graveyard for children,” adding that “the unfolding catastrophe makes the need for a humanitarian ceasefire more urgent.”           Based on the Gazan ministry’s figures, at least one child is being killed  every 10 minutes, CNN calculations suggest.           “The nightmare in Gaza is more than a humanitarian crisis. It is a crisis of humanity,” Guterres reporters at the United Nations in New York.           The UN on Monday launched a $1.2 billion “humanitarian appeal,” Guterres said, calling the “trickle of assistance” making it into Gaza insufficient to “meet the ocean of need.”           Over 560 trucks carrying humanitarian aid have crossed into Gaza since the conflict began nearly a month ago, according to the Palestine Red Crescent, although the Israeli government has not allowed fuel to enter in with the shipments. Before the October 7 attack, about 500 aid trucks were crossing into the area each day.           “Without fuel, newborn babies in incubators and patients on life support will die,” Guterres said.     Israeli ground forces closing in on Gaza City, satellite imagery and videos show         The international charity Save the Children said last month that the number of children reported killed in the enclave during Israel’s campaign had surpassed the annual number of children killed in armed conflict globally in each of the past four years.           In response to Guterres’ comments, Israel’s Ambassador to the UN Gilad Erdan called for his resignation, accusing him of making “the false immoral comparison between a brutal terrorist organization that commits war crimes and a law-abiding democracy.”           Amid intense criticism of the mounting death toll, the IDF has also released images that it alleged show Hamas using civilian infrastructure, including hospitals and children’s playgrounds, as shields for its attacks – a claim that the Ramallah-based Palestinian Authority Ministry of Health as well as Hamas-controlled government media have rejected.           On Sunday, the head of the Hamas government media Salama Marouf called for the UN to verify Israel’s claims about the use of hospitals as shields.           “We are ready to receive any international committee assembled by the UN, the WHO, the International Red Cross, or any international body to come and examine closely and refute the lies and slanders about hospitals,” Marouf said. “[The hospitals] are used for one purpose, which is to provide medical care to the wounded, injured and sick.”           The United States has backed Israel’s campaign throughout the war, saying it has a right to defend itself. It vetoed a UN Security Council resolution for humanitarian pauses to deliver aid into Gaza on October 18, but President Joe Biden on Wednesday said that he was supportive of a humanitarian pause to allow for the release of more hostages held in Gaza.     Washington has also warned Israel that it will become increasingly difficult for it to pursue its military goals in Gaza as global outcry intensifies about the scale of humanitarian suffering there.           Israel’s operation in Gaza has triggered protests across the world and prompted warnings of a potential intervention from Iran-backed militants in the region, which have already been engaged in skirmishes with the Israeli military.           Israel is, however, yet to show any signs of backing down, saying its operations in Gaza are only expanding.           Nearly 1.5 million Gazans have already been displaced in the 140-square-meter strip, the United Nations Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA) said Friday, with thousands sheltering in crammed schools and hospitals with dwindling food, water and power.    © 2023 Cable News Network.

world,Jailed Nobel Peace Prize winner Narges Mohammadi ends hunger strike,https://edition.cnn.com/2023/11/09/middleeast/nobel-peace-prize-winner-narges-mohammadi-ends-hunger-strike-iran-intl/index.html,"       The imprisoned Iranian Nobel Peace Prize winner Narges Mohammadi has ended her hunger strike after three days, according to a statement from her media team on Thursday.            She had been striking over what she said was the jail’s refusal to provide her with medical treatment.           Mohammadi ended the action on Wednesday after being allowed to leave Tehran’s Evin Prison to visit a hospital for medical care without wearing the mandatory hijab, the statement said.           Mohammadi said in the statement that she had experienced the most secure transfer in all the years of her imprisonment.           “Before my arrival at the hospital, security forces were stationed at the hospital entrance, parking lot, elevator, and the corridor leading to the doctor’s office, all under their control,” she said.     Nobel Peace Prize won by Narges Mohammadi for ‘fight against the oppression of women in Iran’         “I was surrounded by security forces everywhere. I was confined in a small room whose doors were closed and controlled by security personnel, and even my blood tests were conducted there.”           The statement continued: “I was not allowed to speak with my lawyer. My family members, who I didn’t even get to see, were identified and threatened with detention based on the prosecutor’s order.”           Mohammadi’s treatment continues to spark widespread condemnation. The Norwegian Nobel Committee called the requirement that female inmates wear the hijab for medical treatment “inhumane.”           Human rights watchdog Amnesty International accused the Iranian government of “callously toying” with Mohammadi’s life in a statement on X, the platform formerly known as Twitter, on Wednesday.           The 51-year-old rights activist was awarded the Nobel on October 6 for “her fight against the oppression of women in Iran and her fight to promote human rights and freedom for all.” That battle has come at a huge personal cost – she’s been sentenced to more than 30 years in jail, and has been banned from seeing her husband and children.           Mohammadi has spent most of the past two decades in prison and is currently serving a sentence of 10 years and nine months, accused of actions against national security and propaganda against the state.           In a letter written from the notorious Evin Prison earlier this year and shared with CNN, Mohammadi railed against the government’s policy of compulsory hijab, calling it a “deceitful scheme against women” and a tool “to strengthen the power of the religious government.”           In August she was sentenced to an additional year in jail for her continued activism behind bars after she gave a media interview and a statement about sexual assaults in prison, which she says have “significantly increased” since protests swept Iran last year, leading her to describe the abuse as now “systematic.”           The Iranian government has denied the widespread allegations of sexual assaults against detainees, including in an in-depth CNN investigation last year, calling them “false” and “baseless.”  © 2023 Cable News Network.

world,UN report warns war has already set Gaza and West Bank economy back more than a decade,https://edition.cnn.com/2023/11/09/middleeast/un-report-gaza-economic-impact-poverty/index.html,"       Israel’s war on Hamas could set the Palestinian economy in Gaza and the West Bank back decades, according to a new analysis by the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP).           A report released Thursday by the organization paints a dire picture of the economic conditions in the Palestinian enclave, where more than 10,700 people have been killed in the response to the October 7 terror attack in Israel, according to the Palestinian Ministry of Health in Ramallah, which draws from sources in the Hamas-controlled enclave.           Since the start of the latest conflict, the number of Palestinians living in poverty has risen by 300,000, according to Abdallah Al Dardari, director of the UNDP Regional Bureau for Arab States.           Almost 1.5 million people in Gaza have been displaced since the fighting began last month, according to the United Nations Relief and Works Agency, while Israel’s blockade on fuel combined with severe restrictions on food, water and medical deliveries has sparked a humanitarian crisis.           Key economic measurements, including employment rates and GDP, have all plunged across Gaza and the West Bank, according to the UNDP analysis.           The past month of conflict has erased 61 percent of employment in Gaza and 24 percent of employment in the West Bank, the report warns. Palestinian GDP is expected to have fallen 4.2 percent after one month of war compared with pre-war estimates, a los﻿s of about $857 million. If the war lasts through a second month, that figure would rise to $1.7 billion, about an 8.4 percent loss of GDP, it adds.           “That is massive,” Al Dardari said in an interview. “I’ve been following conflicts for 30 years and writing on them, I have never seen such a dramatic shock in such a short time,” he told CNN.           Poverty in Gaza was already severe before Israel’s October campaign – with 61 percent of the population considered below the poverty line in 2020, according to the World Bank.           Access to the crowded enclave of some 2 million people has been severely curtailed by Israel and Egypt for the last 17 years in what NGO Human Rights Watch has long dubbed an “open-air prison.”           The latest outbreak of war has only deepened the economic misfortune.           After one month of fighting, the number of people living in poverty in Gaza and the West Bank increased by nearly 20 percent, the UNDP report says. If the war were to last a second month, the total increase of the population in poverty would top 34 percent, or 500,000 people, according to Al Dardari.           Structural damage in the densely developed area has been extensive throughout the four-week Israeli campaign, with nearly half of the housing stock said to have been damaged or destroyed by the bombardment and 40 percent of educational facilities damaged, according to United Nations Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs.           Overall, the UNDP report predicts an 11 to 16-year setback in a metric it calls “human development” across Gaza and the West Bank, due to the conflict so far. The estimation comes from a UNDP assessment of educational, health, and economic indicators that contribute to the state’s score on the Human Development Index.         If the fighting were to continue through a second month, the Palestinian economy would be set back 19 years’ worth of development, Al Dardari said.           “That means Palestine will go back to 2001, 2002,” he said. “Every investment the international community, the Palestinian people, have put into their human development – health, education, growth, business – everything that was built since 2002 is lost.”           Officials in Israel have not given any public indication of the expected length of the military operation in Gaza, outside of declarations that the war is likely to be long, and that the goal of the air and ground offensive is the complete elimination of Hamas.            Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu reiterated as recently as Wednesday that he would not approve of a cease fire until the around 240 hostages being held in Gaza were released.           Still, questions have risen over the post-war management of Gaza in recent days, after Netanyahu told an interviewer Monday that Israel should have “overall security responsibility” in the Palestinian enclave for an “indefinite period.” His advisors have since said that Israel would seek security control in the region, not governing power.           UNDP has not produced an estimate of the costs for reconstruction in Gaza once a ceasefire is reached, given uncertainty around the length of the campaign. Al Dardari said UNDP would likely eventually be involved in rebuilding the battered enclave, although he warned that a continued Israeli blockade would complicate the process.           “From a technical point of view,” he said, “a massive reconstruction exercise and a blockade don’t go hand in hand.”    © 2023 Cable News Network.

world,Mohamed Nureldin Abdallah/Reuters,https://edition.cnn.com/2023/11/08/africa/ethnic-groups-rounded-up-in-sudans-darfur-intl/index.html,"       Members of African ethnic groups in Sudan’s Darfur region appear to have been rounded up by members of the paramilitary Rapid Support Forces and other Arab militias, according to videos and images verified and geolocated by CNN.           The videos emerged over the weekend. In one of them shared online and geolocated to Ardamata, an outlying district in El Geneina city in West Darfur state, racist slurs can be heard as men in fatigues refer to the captives as “dogs” and tell them to “gather here”.           In another cut of the video, the same men in fatigues can be seen whipping the men. At one point the men appear to be forced to run down the street. A man fires shots.     UN investigates reports of 13 mass graves in Sudan’s Darfur region         In another video, filmed less than a five-minute drive from the first video, the RSF logo appears visible on the uniforms of some of the men dressed in light colored fatigues who appear to be controlling the men huddled together on the ground. The word “liquidation” is mentioned and the words “slay them”.           The RSF on Saturday announced it had taken over the main army base in El Geneina (the 15th division headquarters), close to where these videos were filmed.           A Reuters reporter spoke to three men fleeing from Darfur into Chad on Tuesday who said they had witnessed killings by Arab militias and RSF forces targeting the Masalit ethnic group in Ardamata, the news agency reported.           “Sickening reports and images coming from Ardamata, West Darfur, inc [sic] of assassinations, grave violations and massacres of civilians, following RSF takeover of area. Those with authority must uphold international humanitarian law, protect civilians, ensure rule of law and provide unfettered humanitarian access to vulnerable persons,” the UN’s deputy humanitarian coordinator in Sudan, Toby Harward, wrote on X, formerly known as Twitter.           The RSF has denied that “any incidents of ethnic cleansing or tribal conflict took place in the Ardmetta [Ardamata] area of El Geneina, West Darfur State.”           In a statement responding to questions from CNN on Wednesday, the RSF said it does not target civilians and its forces are “fighting side-by-side with the people of Sudan to restore our country to its rightful path of civilian-led democratic rule.”           The paramilitary group said, however, that as a result of the conflict between RSF and the Sudanese Armed Forces (SAF) in the Ardamata neighborhood, their actions “did unfortunately result in the displacement of civilians” as the military zone is located amid residential areas.           “The conflict ended with our forces seizing control of the SAF 15th Infantry Division and liberating the division headquarters,” the statement said, adding that “since the division was liberated, Ardmetta has seen no further acts of aggression or armed conflict. Residents have returned to their homes, and security has stabilized, allowing life to resume as normal.”           Amidst the most significant increase in displacement in months, aid agencies operating in Chad say arrivals from Sudan have been describing a new surge in killings and fighting in West Darfur.           Ethnic related killings have intensified since fighting broke out mid-April between the Sudanese Armed Forces (SAF) and the RSF, according to witnesses and aid groups operating in the region.           In September, the United Nations’ human rights body (UNJHRO) said it had received reports of at least 13 mass graves in El Geneina believed to contain civilians from the ethnic Masalit tribe who were allegedly killed in attacks by the RSF and allied Arab militias.           Médecins Sans Frontières (MSF) said Tuesday that, following increased fighting in El Geneina, its teams working across the border in eastern Chad have seen an “immediate and major increase in the number of people arriving in the region.”           “Our people there in Ardmata were killed and displaced. Children are slaughtered, women’s money and belongings are robbed, and they can’t escape,” one Sudanese woman, Nabila Abdel Rahman, told Reuters on Tuesday.           In neighboring South Sudan, the UN’s humanitarian agency (OCHA) said there has also been a “significant increase in Sudanese refugees in the past few days.”           MSF said at its hospital in Adré, a 27-year-old man told them he fled El Geneina with 16 other people, but their group was attacked on the road to Chad. He said the attackers killed everyone, but he survived by playing dead.           “Eventually a new group of refugees arrived and helped him reach the border. He has multiple bullet wounds on his hands and legs,” the MSF news release said.           The incidents described to aid agencies follow a pattern of similar alleged abuses by the RSF since the conflict began, according to multiple CNN reports.           “In the first three days of November, we have seen more new arrivals of Sudanese refugees than during the whole previous month; about 7,000 people crossed the border,” MSF outreach coordinator, Stephanie Hoffmann, said.           UN refugee agency (UNHCR) director of external relations Dominique Hyde said she witnessed a surge in human suffering when she visited Sudan last week.           In the Darfur region, fighting between the Sudanese Armed Forces (SAF) and RSF has caused even more displacement with thousands struggling to find shelter and many sleeping under trees by the roadside, a UNCHR news release said.     Landmark buildings ablaze in Khartoum as Sudan fighting erupts         “Child malnutrition is rampant, women are being raped, violence prevails and entire families are sleeping outside with no roof over their heads,” Hyde wrote on X, formerly Twitter.           Since the war in Sudan broke out in April, 4.5 million people have been internally displaced and an estimated 1.2 million have fled to neighbouring countries, according to UNHCR.           On Tuesday, the US State Department announced that during talks in Jeddah, the SAF and RSF “committed to take steps to facilitate increased humanitarian assistance, and to implement confidence-building measures”.           They were unable to agree on a ceasefire implementation.           “The Kingdom of Saudi Arabia, IGAD, also on behalf of the African Union, and the United States call upon the SAF and RSF to put the Sudanese people first, silence the guns, and seek a negotiated end to this needless war,” a joint statement from the talks released by the State Department said.           It comes after US Secretary of State Anthony Blinken called for an “immediate cessation of attacks” in El Fasher in North Darfur.           “The United States is deeply troubled by reports of an imminent large-scale attack by Sudan’s Rapid Support Forces (RSF) on El Fasher, North Darfur, that would subject civilians, including hundreds of thousands of displaced persons – many of whom only recently fled to El Fasher from other areas – to extreme danger,” Blinken said in a press statement on November 2.

world,Kenya announces public holiday for nationwide tree planting in reforestation drive,https://edition.cnn.com/2023/11/08/africa/kenya-public-holiday-tree-planting-intl-scli/index.html,"       The Kenyan government has declared that Monday will be a “special holiday” in which people nationwide will be expected to plant trees to help with the country’s land restoration efforts.           Kithure Kindiki, cabinet secretary for the Interior and Administration of National Government in Kenya, made the announcement in a post on X on Monday in which he wrote, “the public across the Country shall be expected to plant trees as a patriotic contribution to the national efforts to save our Country from the devastating effects of Climate Change.”           Posting an official notice declaring November 13, 2023 to be National Tree Growing Day, Kindiki added that those with national exams that day “shall proceed normally.”           The exercise will form part of Kenya’s Landscape and Ecosystem Restoration Programme, which aims to grow and nurture 15 billion trees by 2032 to restore and conserve 10.6 million hectares of degraded landscapes and ecosystems, according to the notice.           There will be a national venue and 47 county venues dedicated to the tree planting, “where all Kenyan citizens and the general public will be expected to participate,” the notice said.           Kenya’s forest cover decreased from 12% to just 6% between 1990 and 2010, according to the United Nation’s Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO). In 2022, the figure went up to 9%, according to the Kenya Forest Service, which said in a post on X on Monday that it “welcomes all Kenyans to mark the celebration” by planting trees.     Growing and burying algae in the Sahara is the latest solution for the climate crisis         Yet rising demands for timber and charcoal to fuel infrastructure and population growth continue to contribute to the unsustainable harvesting of forests. Although the country depends on less biomass energy than neighboring Tanzania and Uganda, fuelwood still makes up around 70% of Kenya’s energy needs.           Deforestation and land degradation threaten vital ecosystems and lead to conflict and the loss of biodiversity, particularly amid increased droughts due to climate change and poor water management, according to FAO.           In May, ten lions were killed in human-wildlife conflict that worsened following Kenya’s worst drought in more than 40 years.           The Kenyan government wants forest cover to reach 30% in order to better conserve biodiversity, sustain livelihoods and the environment, improve climate resilience and improve social-economic development, according to the World Wildlife Fund.           At the two-day Kenya Restoration Forum in Nairobi last month, Martin Mulama, manager of the Southern Kenya Programme at WWF Kenya, said, “At the center of the ambitious 15 Billion Trees initiative are communities – the first-line custodians of our landscapes and ecosystems. They should be included, engaged, and involved in the implementation and benefit from the National Landscape and Ecosystem Restoration.”    © 2023 Cable News Network. A Warner Bros.

world,South Africa’s Transport Minister and bodyguards robbed at gunpoint,https://edition.cnn.com/2023/11/08/africa/south-africa-minister-robbed-at-gunpoint-intl/index.html,"       South Africa’s transport minister and her bodyguards were robbed at gunpoint on Monday, according to the South African Police Service (SAPS).           Minister Sindisiwe Chikunga was travelling on the N3 highway between Vosloorus and Heidelberg, south of Johannesburg, on Monday when the incident took place, police said.           Recounting the incident to MPs during a parliamentary committee hearing on Tuesday, the minister said the “whole experience was very traumatizing and devastating.”           Chikunga said it happened at around 3.30am local time after the car she was traveling in suffered a puncture. She was inside the car while her bodyguards changed the tire. When she looked out of the window, she saw people with a gun “pointing at the protectors.”     10 members of same family killed in South Africa mass shooting         Chikunga said she tried to pull out her phone to call for help but “before I could do anything they opened the door and pointed a fire gun at my head.”           Three well-dressed men ordered her to get out of the car and then asked for money, she recalled.           She said they searched her bodyguards and tried to take her ring, but she said no because it is “the only thing I have between my late husband and myself.”           SAPS said two police service pistols and personal belongings were stolen during the robbery. A manhunt has been launched following the incident and the victims are receiving support and counseling, SAPS said.           South Africa has long grappled with gun violence, with several mass shootings reported this year. The country also has one of the world’s highest murder rates, according to local police data.           In April, 10 people including a 13-year-old boy were killed by gunmen in the KwaZulu-Natal province. The victims were members of the same family.    © 2023 Cable News Network. A Warner Bros.

The cause of mysterious mass deaths of African elephants has finally been unraveled — and scientists who authored a new report say that the outbreaks could be more likely to occur amid conditions created by the ongoing climate crisis.           Thirty-five African elephants in northwestern Zimbabwe dropped dead under baffling circumstances between late August and November 2020. Eleven of the massive herd animals died within a 24-hour period.           “They died over a very narrow window. That’s one of the most enigmatic parts of the whole puzzle. That many animals dying quite close together but not right next to each other over such a narrow space of time. It’s really to my mind, rather unique, certainly in this part of the world,” said Dr. Chris Foggin, a veterinarian at Victoria Falls Wildlife Trust in Zimbabwe, who is a coauthor of the study on the cause of the deaths.           Earlier that same year, about 350 elephants in neighboring northern Botswana also had died suddenly over the course of three months.           Officials and experts were initially at a loss to explain the die-offs, which occurred among Africa’s biggest population of elephants. Poaching, poisoning and drought were all blamed.           It turns out a bacterial infection killed the elephants in Zimbabwe, according to the research based on samples taken from 15 of the animals that died in that country.           An analysis, published October 25 in the journal Nature Communications, showed evidence of infection by a little-known bacterium called Bisgaard taxon 45 that caused septicemia, or blood poisoning.           The deaths took place as food and water resources dwindled during the dry season, forcing the elephants to travel increasing distances to look for water and to forage.           The authors said that heat, drought and population density in that area were likely contributing factors to the outbreak.           And the extreme conditions that scientists project will occur with more frequency as Earth warms could mean more elephant deaths in the future.           “It’s premature to say that climate change has influenced (this) but it may do so in future if we get more and prolonged droughts, or the rainfall patterns (change) and we have a much harsher dry season,” Foggin said. “I do think that if that is the case, then we are more likely to see this sort of mortality event occurring again.”           The elephant mortalities in Botswana have been attributed to cyanobacterial neurotoxins, but further details have not been published, the study noted. Foggin said there was no proven connection between the Zimbabwe and Botswana elephant deaths.           The African elephant is a flagship species that faces significant pressure from poaching and habitat loss. Listed as endangered on the International Union for Conservation of Nature Red List, population numbers diminished by 144,000 to about 350,000 between 2007 and 2014, with continuing losses estimated at 8% every year, according to the study.     Using AI to monitor orphaned elephants in Botswana could usher in the return of the woolly mammoth         Some 227,900 elephants live in the Kavango–Zambezi Transfrontier Conservation Area — 500,000 square kilometers (193,051 square miles) of protected land, which is about 90% within Botswana and Zimbabwe.           Evidence of infection was found in six out of the 15 samples, the study authors wrote, which was corroborated by isolating the bacterium in the lab and in-depth genetic analysis.           There was no evidence of toxins, including those from cyanobacteria, or any viral infection.           In addition, no dead scavengers or other wildlife species were reported or observed in the vicinity of dead elephants as would be expected with cyanide or other intentional poisoning, the study noted.           “Although there was not culture or molecular evidence to confirm Bisgaard taxon 45 in more than six mortalities in Zimbabwe, the elephants examined were in good body condition and unlikely to have died of drought-related starvation or severe dehydration alone,” the study noted.     Last of the ‘Super Tuskers’: Saving Kenya’s majestic megafauna         No elephants had their tusks removed from poaching, and no external signs of trauma were observed. Tests for anthrax were also negative, Foggin added.           The researchers said they failed to detect the bacteria in the other samples — a fact they attributed to poor sample quality and delays getting the necessary permits that meant it was too late to perform some lab work.           “Most carcasses were degraded at the time of sampling, making the initial sample quality poor. Additionally, exporting wildlife samples for analysis involves obtaining multiple permits from different entities — a process which can take months,” the study said.           Bisgaard taxon 45 has previously been associated with tiger and lion bite wounds in humans. The bacteria have also been found in a chipmunk and healthy captive parrots.     Desert elephants are finding friends in the drylands of Namibia         The microorganism, which does not have an official name, is closely related to another, more common bacterium known as of Pasteurella multocida, which can cause hemorrhagic septicemia in other animals, including Asian elephants.           That﻿ bacterium was also linked to the mass deaths of 200,000 critically endangered saiga antelope in Kazakhstan in 2015, the study noted.           Foggin said researchers had been monitoring wildlife in the area for presence of the bacteria, but no further elephant deaths as a result of Bisgaard taxon 45 had been confirmed since 2020.    © 2023 Cable News Network.

world,Roberto Cisneros/AFP/Getty Images,https://edition.cnn.com/2023/11/08/americas/demonstrators-killed-mining-protests-panama/index.html,"       Anti-mining protests that have roiled Panama for the last two weeks turned deadly on Tuesday when a man allegedly shot and killed two demonstrators, according to police.           A chilling video posted by bystanders on X, formerly known as Twitter, showed a disheveled elderly man apparently frustrated with the logjam trying to force the protestors to remove a barrier blocking the Pan American highway about 50 miles south of the capital, before pulling out a pistol and opening fire. Panama’s National Police later said they arrested the suspected gunman at the scene of the shooting.           The unusual scene of violence is the latest flashpoint in some of the largest protests to hit the Central American nation since Panamanians flooded the streets en masse to demonstrate against the dictatorship of Manuel Noriega in the 1980s.           For weeks, tens of thousands of protestors have vented their fury at a controversial mining contract given to Minera Panama, the local subsidiary of a Canadian mining company, to extract copper, a key component in electric car batteries.           The contract allows Canada’s First Quantum Minerals to restart an open-pit copper mine surrounded by rain forest for the next 20 years, with the possibility of extending for another 20 years.           Environmentalists say the mine could contaminate drinking water and devastate tracts of the 32,000 acres the company negotiated use of, in exchange for yearly payments of $375 million.           Panama’s government has promised, however, that the mine will bring thousands of jobs in addition to the badly needed revenue. First Quantum Minerals did not respond to CNN’s request for comment on the protests.           Opposition to the mine has united environmentalists, indigenous groups and teachers’ and construction unions who see allegations of backroom dealings between the government and the mining company as further evidence of widespread official corruption.           The protestors accuse the government of selling off the nation’s natural resources at the same moment many Panamanians have been hit with the costs of rising inflation and are feeling the impacts of climate change.           “Panamanians are suffering from lack of water, suffering from droughts, principally in the central provinces, animals that die, harvests that don’t happen,” environmental activist Martita Cornejo told CNN en Español.           “The government did not guage the opposition from Panamanian society to a mining contract.”           But former US ambassador to Panama John Feeley said while much of the outrage is real, the new contract announcement has also presented an opportunity for some groups to try to force their own concessions and win sweetheart deals from the government.           “This is the horrible thing about Panama: Even when you protest corruption, you are probably facilitating it as well,” he said.           Weeks of road blocks set up by protesters have shut down the country, preventing farmers from bringing crops to market and sequestering Panamanians in their homes. According to Panama’s association of company executives, the standstill inflicts $80 million in daily losses to local businesses. Celebrations to mark Panama’s independence from Colombia in 1903 were also widely cancelled last week.           Panama’s President Laurentino Cortizo has defended the mining deal after its announcement on October 20, saying the agreement would create jobs and revenue for Panama.           The mine had provided a rare economic bright spot for Panama where tourism has been slow to recover from the pandemic and the drought has reduced traffic though the Panama Canal, which is expected to a cause a drop of revenue of $200 million in 2024.           “We made the right decision, not the easiest one,” Cortizo said. “After a difficult and complicated negotiation for more than two years, a contract was agreed in 2023 between the company Minera Panama and the Panamanian State, which guarantees much better terms and conditions for the country.”           But as the protests have dragged on, Panama’s government has offered concessions that have done little to deflate the crisis: Last week, congress passed a moratorium on all future metal mining and Cortizo called for a nationwide referendum in December on the controversial project.           In 2017, Panama’s Supreme Court declared another contract to operate the copper mine as unconstitutional, forcing the mining company and government to renegotiate the deal.           Opponents now say they are hopeful that an announcement by Panama’s Supreme Court this week that it is examining the legality of the contract could once again kill the deal.           Whatever the resolution to the crisis, it may be too late to repair the damage done to Panama’s reputation in the region as a rare bastion of political and economic stability.    © 2023 Cable News Network.

world,Pablo Escobar’s ‘cocaine hippos’ face Colombian government cull,https://edition.cnn.com/2023/11/03/americas/pablo-escobars-cocaine-hippos-face-cull-colombia-intl-scli-scn/index.html," Pablo Escobar’s notorious “cocaine hippos” are facing a cull, according to a statement from Colombia’s minister of environment and sustainable development Thursday.           The herd, which the Colombian government said currently stands at 169 animals, has rapidly reproduced from the original population of one male and three females the drug kingpin owned as part of his private collection of exotic creatures.           After Escobar’s death in 1993, authorities relocated most of the other animals in the collection, but not the hippos – because they were too difficult to transport. Free from any natural predator, the rising population poses an environmental challenge. If “strong measures” are not taken to control them, the population could boom to “1,000 individuals by 2035,” the statement said.           This new phase to control the hippo population involves three strategies: sterilization, relocation and “ethical euthanasia,” it added.           “All three strategies have to work together,” Environment Minister Susana Muhamad said in the statement. “Here we are in a race against time in terms of the permanent environmental and ecosystem impacts that are being generated and that is why we cannot say that only one strategy is effective for our objective, which is to control the population.”           In 2021, scientists recommended culling the hippos to prevent long-term negative effects, but other scientists are calling instead for a castration program, citing concerns over animal welfare.     Pablo Escobar ‘cocaine hippo’ dies in Colombia after being hit by car         Between 2011 and 2019, four males were castrated and two females were sterilized, but this did little to slow the hippos’ progress. Putting the hippos on birth control was similarly ineffective. There have also been plans to relocate some of the population to India, the Philippines and Mexico, with the logistics of sending 60 to India currently being analyzed, the statement said.           “We are looking to implement this plan in the shortest possible time, precisely so that the impacts cease,” Muhamad explained.           According to the ministry statement, sterilization will cost the country an average of 40 million pesos ($10,000) per animal, and will begin from next week, with an aim to sterilize 40 a year.           The minister concluded by emphasizing that hippos have been declared an “invasive exotic” with “aggressive characteristics,” and that “their presence represents a threat to ecosystems and risks for the communities that surround them.”           Research has shown negative effects of hippo waste on oxygen levels in bodies of water, which can affect fish and ultimately humans. Hippos also pose a threat to agriculture and to the security of people in affected areas, according to a 2021 study. In April, a hippo descended from Escobar’s collection died after being hit by a car.     Correction: An earlier version of this story misstated the rate at which the hippos will be sterilized.

world,Fossil unearthed in North Dakota could help solve an evolutionary mystery,https://edition.cnn.com/2023/11/02/americas/mosasaur-fossil-jormungandr-walhallaensis-scn/index.html,"       An enormous sea snake from Norse legend that was fathered by the trickster god Loki and grew big enough to circle the globe is now the namesake for a different type of “monster” — a newly discovered species of a massive, meat-eating marine reptile known as a mosasaur, which lived about 80 million years ago.           Paleontologists recently described the previously unknown mosasaur from fossils found near the North Dakota town of Walhalla. The town’s name comes from Valhalla, the feasting hall of Norse mythology where dead heroes gather, so the scientists dubbed the mosasaur Jormungandr walhallaensis. Its name references Norse myths of Jǫrmungandr, the Midgard Serpent, as well as the site of the fossil’s discovery, the researchers reported Monday in the journal Bulletin of the American Museum of Natural History.     ‘Once in a lifetime’ fossil reveals a dinosaur and mammal locked in mortal combat         The fossil itself has a somewhat less poetic name: NDGS 10838. It includes a near-complete skull with a bony ridge over the eyes as well as jaws and some skeletal parts, including 11 ribs and 12 vertebrae. In life, the animal would have measured about 24 feet (7.3 meters) long and had a long face slimmer than those of its mosasaur cousins, said lead study author Amelia Zietlow, a paleontologist and doctoral candidate at the American Museum of Natural History’s Richard Gilder Graduate School in New York City.           In general, Jormungandr walhallaensis resembled most mosasaurs — “kind of like if you took a Komodo dragon, made it 30 feet long and gave it flippers and a shark tail,” Zietlow told CNN.           Yet in other ways, the animal was one of a kind. A mix of features in the bones of its skull made it unexpectedly challenging for the scientists to classify the newcomer and hinted that the mosasaur group includes more diverse forms than expected, the study authors reported.           The fossil was collected in 2015 by the North Dakota Geological Survey, a state agency dedicated to geology and public education about minerals and fossils. In fact, Zietlow said, NDGS 10838 was discovered in a hillside by someone who had participated in one of the agency’s programs, and who was therefore able to recognize the object as a fossil and knew to alert agency officials.           When the scientists examined the skull, they quickly realized they had something unusual on their hands. Its ear bones, which were somewhat rectangular, resembled those of Mosasaurus, the genus of mosasaur giants. But the shape and high number of its teeth were a closer match to a genus of smaller mosasaurs: Clidastes. Meanwhile, the angle and number of teeth on a bony palate at the roof of its mouth were unlike anything seen in either of those two mosasaur groups.           “He’s got features that look in some ways like Mosasaurus, in some ways like Clidastes. And then in other ways, they’re completely unique to this individual,” Zietlow said. This combination of traits convinced the researchers that what they were looking at was a new genus and species.           However, fossilization often distorts bone, and it’s possible that oddities in the fossil were shaped by natural processes after the animal’s death, said paleontologist Takuya Konishi, an associate professor in the department of biological sciences at the University of Cincinnati. (The authors acknowledged this possibility; their study includes idealized illustrations of the intact skull showing what it may have looked like before it fossilized.)           When the researchers analyzed the data, their evolutionary tree showed an outcome called a polytomy — “when a bunch of different species kind of blur together into a single spot” — with Jormungandr walhallaensis and Clidastes, Zietlow said. “They’re closer to each other than they are to anything else. But within that group of things, it’s not quite sure how they’re related.”     Asteroid that doomed the dinosaurs halted a key process for life on Earth, scientists say         Additional fossils of the newfound species could help fine-tune Jormungandr walhallaensis’ position on the mosasaur family tree, said Konishi, who studies mosasaur evolution and was not involved in the study.           “Just how distinct J. walhallaensis is from Clidastes has yet to be investigated further,” Konishi told CNN in an email. “Future discoveries may favor an alternative hypothesis that it is a new species of Clidastes.”           Other unusual details in the fossil are punctures and scratches scarring the vertebrae; the researchers identified these as bite marks. The marks do not appear to have healed, suggesting that they happened toward the end of the animal’s life or were the work of a scavenger that ripped the mosasaur apart after it was dead.           “This might be why we don’t have the rest of the skeleton,” Zietlow said.           Further questions about what made the marks — and whether it was an attack that Jormungandr walhallaensis survived — will be addressed in future research by study coauthor Clint Boyd, a senior paleontologist with the North Dakota Geological Survey and a curator of the North Dakota State Fossil Collection, Zietlow said.           Mosasaurs were a diverse group of apex predators that swam the world’s oceans during the latter part of the Cretaceous Period, about 98 million to 66 million years ago. They lived alongside dinosaurs but are more closely related to modern lizards and snakes.           Some mosasaurs measured just a few feet long, while the largest — in the genus Mosasaurus — was nearly 60 feet (18.2 meters) long, and while mosasaur fossils are relatively plentiful, scientists “have just only scratched the surface of the ‘true’ mosasaur diversity,” Konishi said. New mosasaur specimens, such as NDGS 10838, help experts to unravel “the rich evolutionary history of these rather charismatic apex predators of the Cretaceous seas,” he said.           To that end, the new study makes a significant contribution by supplying “rich anatomical detail documented by a very able mosasaur worker, Ms. Zietlow,” he added.     New fossils reveal specialized eating technique of unusual ancient marine reptile         “The authors clearly provided a very thorough and careful osteological description of the new specimen,” creating a treasure trove of exceptional data, Konishi said.           Though mosasaurs were aquatic, their ancestors lived on land and then evolved to return to the sea. They weren’t the only animal group to do so; many types of reptiles and mammals — including plesiosaurs, whales, sea turtles and seals — adapted to ocean life from terrestrial ancestors, long after their even more distant tetrapod ancestors left the seas for land. And mosasaurs are an important animal group for studying this transition because their fossils are so abundant, Zietlow said.           “There are a lot of them, literally thousands of specimens in the United States alone,” she said. “That makes them good for studying big picture, statistical-type evolutionary questions.”           Despite the plentiful pool of specimens, many mosasaur fossils were not documented as exhaustively as Jormungandr walhallaensis was (and in some cases, were barely illustrated at all when they were first described, Zietlow said).           Addressing this discrepancy in newfound fossils — and revisiting known specimens — will play a big part in helping scientists solve these evolutionary riddles.           “I spent a lot of time putting together these figures, showing the bones in every view and showing all of the little lumps and bumps and things, so that future people can look at these figures and recognize the anatomy and then apply that to making new characters and spotting new differences between this animal and other animals,” Zietlow said. “That just helps everyone overall to understand the anatomy of these things a little bit better.”     Mindy Weisberger is a science writer and media producer whose work has appeared in Live Science, Scientific American and How It Works magazine.  © 2023 Cable News Network.

world,"Asteroid that doomed the dinosaurs halted a key process for life on Earth, scientists say",https://edition.cnn.com/2023/10/30/americas/asteroid-dust-dinosaur-extinction-photosynthesis-scn/index.html," Sign up for CNN’s Wonder Theory science newsletter. Explore the universe with news on fascinating discoveries, scientific advancements and more.         The age of the dinosaurs ended 66 million years ago when a city-size asteroid struck a shallow sea off the coast of what is now Mexico.           But exactly how the mass extinction of 75% of the species on Earth unfolded in the years that followed the cataclysmic impact has remained unclear.           Previous research suggested that sulfur released during the impact, which left the 112-mile-wide (180-kilometer-wide) Chicxulub crater, and soot from wildfires triggered a global winter, and temperatures plunged.           However, a new study published Monday in the journal Nature Geoscience suggests that fine dust made from pulverized rock thrown up into Earth’s atmosphere in the wake of the impact likely played a greater role. This dust blocked the sun to an extent that plants were unable to photosynthesize, a biological process critical for life, for almost two years afterward.           “Photosynthesis shutting down for almost two years after impact caused severe challenges (for life),” said lead study author and planetary scientist Cem Berk Senel, a postdoctoral researcher at the Royal Observatory of Belgium. “It collapsed the food web, creating a chain reaction of extinctions.”           To reach their findings, scientists developed a new computer model to simulate the global climate after the asteroid strike. The model was based on published information on Earth’s climate at that point in time, as well as new data from sediment samples taken from the Tanis fossil site in North Dakota that captured a 20-year period during the aftermath of the strike.           The Tanis fossil site provides a unique record of what was perhaps the most significant event in the history of life on our planet. Fossilized fish found at the site have revealed that the asteroid struck off Mexico’s Yucatán Peninsula in springtime. Other fossils found there show how the disastrous day unfolded in unprecedented detail.           The sample from the site analyzed for the new study contained silicate dust particles that were thrust into the atmosphere in a plume of ejecta before returning to Earth.           The team determined that this fine dust could have remained in the atmosphere for up to 15 years after the asteroid strike. The researchers suggested the global climate may have cooled by as much as 15 degrees Celsius.           Their research marked the first time these dust particles had been studied in detail.           “It had been long assumed that the main killing mechanism was extreme cold following the Chicxulub impact, but of course the cessation of photosynthesis after impact is a mechanism itself,” Senel said.           “Within a few weeks, months (of the impact), the planet underwent a global shutdown in photosynthesis, which continued for almost two years during which photosynthesis is completely gone,” Senel added. “Then it starts getting back to recovery after these two years. … Within three to four years, it reaches a complete recovery.”           Senel said the model revealed that the shutdown of photosynthesis — the process by which plants use sunlight, water and carbon dioxide to produce energy and oxygen — was directly linked to the fine dust ejected into the atmosphere that blocked the sun.           Paleontologist Alfio Alessandro Chiarenza said the study helped unravel some of the mysteries surrounding the mass extinction event.         “The main takeaway from this paper is that it provides more precise constraints on the composition, properties, and duration of the fine dust component ejected from the impact site, which contributed to the global darkness during the impact winter,” said Chiarenza, a postdoctoral research fellow at the University of Vigo in Spain. He was not involved in the study.           “This new information enables us to investigate the processes and duration more rigorously, shedding light on the mechanisms behind the blockage of solar radiation, resulting in photosynthesis shutdown and a significant drop in temperatures below the habitable conditions for example for non-avian dinosaurs,” Chiarenza added.    © 2023 Cable News Network.

world,Kyoto University,https://edition.cnn.com/2023/11/07/asia/japan-wooden-satellite-scn-spc/index.html,"       Aluminum rockets and steel skyscrapers; slick high-speed shuttles and glassy facades: that’s how “the future” has been imagined for decades.           But that’s not what Koji Murata imagines. A researcher at Kyoto University in Japan, Murata has been exploring how biological materials could be used in space.           Murata wondered if he “could build a wooden house on the moon or Mars,” and decided to test the theory — by creating a wooden satellite.           Recent research from the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) found that 10% of atmospheric aerosol in the stratosphere contained metallic particles from spacecraft, including satellites. The long-term impact of these metal fragments is unknown, but scientists are concerned it could damage Earth’s fragile ozone layer.     This massive ‘floating’ museum is straight out of science fiction         Wooden satellites would be better for the planet while still providing the same functionality as their metal counterparts, says Murata.           “At the end of their life, satellites re-enter the atmosphere. The difference is, the wood in the LingoSat will burn up and eventually become a gas, whereas metals become fine particles instead,” says Murata.           It’s not just a pipedream: Murata and his team have been working on the project for four years and sent wood samples to space in 2021 to test the material’s resilience to space conditions.           Now, they are working with Japan’s space agency (JAXA) and NASA to send the prototype satellite, called LingoSat, into orbit early next year.           For Murata, who is head of the space-wood project at Kyoto University, wood is an obvious choice for space structures.           “When you use wood on Earth, you have the problems of burning, rotting, and deformation, but in space, you don’t have those problems: there is no oxygen in space, so it doesn’t burn, and no living creatures live in them, so they don’t rot,” he says.           The strength per weight of wood is the same as aluminum which also makes it a compelling choice for space construction, Murata adds — and the team’s tests conducted at the International Space Station found that wood is remarkably resilient in outer space.           For the satellite, Murata tested three wood types: Erman’s birch — which is commonly found in East Asia — Japanese cherry and magnolia obovata — a species native to Japan. While cypress and cedar would be more common wood types for construction, the team “chose materials that could withstand as much detailed work as possible,” because of the small size of the satellites, says Murata.           Ultimately, the magnolia wood won, as its cells are small and uniform in size, which makes the wood easier to work with and less likely to split or break, he says.           Humans have been putting satellites into orbit since the 1950s, with up to 100 spacecraft launched every year until 2010. But over the past decade, commercial launches have become more accessible and this number has increased dramatically, surpassing 1,400 new satellites in 2021. With the number of rockets sent to space likely to increase, the NOAA research projected that in the coming decades, as much as half of atmospheric aerosol in the stratosphere could contain metallic particles from spacecraft.           Other organizations are also looking to use wood in space.           Finnish startup Arctic Astronautics designed the WISA Woodsat, a wooden satellite that was supposed to be launched into space in 2021. However, company founder Jari Mäkinen says the launch has been held up by bureaucratic hurdles.           “The satellite is ready, waiting in pieces to be put together again when the time comes,” Mäkinen told CNN in an email, adding that once the company receives its space operations license, the satellite will be launched with private rocket rideshare service RocketLab.           At Khalifa University in the United Arab Emirates, aerospace engineer Yarjan Abdul Samad is looking at graphene as a potential material for space objects.           Samad is exploring “nano-wood” — a low-density wood combined with graphene to improve its strength. Samad agrees with Murata that as a renewable and low-density material, wood has the potential to not just build satellites, but future space structures.     A Swedish company is making flat-pack cars – but it’s not the one you think         “There are many research (projects) going on for space agriculture,” says Samad. “If we have wood grown in space, it could be utilized for manufacturing in space.”           However, there are still a lot of unknowns about wood in space structures, says Tatsuhito Fujita, an engineer at JAXA who has been involved in reviewing the LingoSat project.           “The use of natural resources for space hardware (makes sense) from a sustainable development goals perspective, but since wood has never been used in satellites, we cannot tell what kind of benefit we can obtain at this moment,” says Fujita.           For JAXA and the J-Cube Program, the initiative launching the satellite, the priority is safety – and the LingoSat passed its preliminary evaluation with no critical concerns, says Fujita. “JAXA also hopes for lighter, stronger structural materials that are less likely to generate debris, and is conducting research to achieve this goal.”           The LingoSat is in the final stages of its safety review and is expected to launch in a joint mission by JAXA and NASA in the summer of 2024. Murata says they will monitor the satellite for a minimum of six months, to see how it performs in space conditions — such as the extreme changes in temperature in space.     The researchers will monitor the satellite for at least six months as it orbits the Earth, as shown in this render. Credit: Kyoto University         “There is not much reduction in strength from minus 150 to 150 degrees Celsius (-238 to 302 degrees Fahrenheit), we confirmed that in our experiments,” says Murata. “But a satellite goes round the Earth and has these huge temperature differences in 90 minutes. We don’t know to what extent the satellite can withstand this intense, repeated cycle of temperature difference, so this has to be investigated.”           The team will also monitor its reactions to radio waves and magnetic fields, and how the wooden shell protects the satellite’s semiconductor and chip.           In theory, wood should be a cheaper material to manufacture from, although as a novel technology, Murata says they are still working out the costs.           So far, few materials have been used for space missions and objects, says Murata. He hopes that his research and the LingoSat can show the possibilities of other, lower-impact materials.           “It is a renewable, environmentally friendly, and people-friendly material,” says Murata. “I think wood could be used in space development, particularly as an interior material and for radiation shielding material, for small satellites and manned space vehicles.”    © 2023 Cable News Network.

world,"Exclusive: Chinese jet fired flares close to submarine-hunting helicopter in South China Sea, Canadian Navy says",https://edition.cnn.com/2023/11/03/asia/canada-china-helicopter-interception-south-china-sea-hnk-intl/index.html,"       A Chinese warplane fired flares in front of a Canadian military helicopter over international waters of the South China Sea last Sunday, an operation that Canadian military officers said was reckless and could have resulted in the downing of the aircraft.           “The risk to a helicopter in that instance is the flares moving into the rotor blades or the engines so this was categorized as both unsafe and non-standard, unprofessional,” said Maj. Rob Millen, air officer aboard the Royal Canadian Navy frigate HMCS Ottawa, the warship from which the Sikorsky Cyclone helicopter was flying.           The incident was the second of two encounters the Ottawa’s helicopter had with Chinese People’s Liberation Army Navy J-11 fighter jets over international waters on October 29, which saw the fighters get as close as 100 feet from the helicopter, Millen told CNN in an interview aboard the warship.           He said that Canada and other nations have seen Chinese aircraft get close to fixed-wing aircraft on numerous occasions, but it was rare to see such action taken against a helicopter.           The first incident was over international waters outside of 34 miles from the Paracel Island chain in the northern part of the South China Sea. The second was also over international waters outside of 23 miles from the Paracels. The warship was operating in international waters 100 miles (160 kilometers) east of the Paracels at the time.           The Canadian helicopter was searching for a previously detected submarine when the incidents occurred, officers aboard the Ottawa said.           Millen said he was piloting the Canadian helicopter earlier in the day, when Chinese J-11s intercepted it at close range while it flew straight and level at 3,000 feet above the water back toward the Ottawa, a signal to the Chinese that it had no hostile intent.           In that earlier encounter, Millen said the Chinese fighters flew in circles around his helicopter.           “When the intercepting aircraft was closer and closer, at a certain point it became unsafe,” he said.           His helicopter experienced turbulence coming off the Chinese jets, also posing a danger to the copter, Millen said.           “I certainly am not as comfortable as you can be based on the fragility of the rotor system,” he said.           Millen said he ended that encounter by descending to 200 feet, an area where the helicopter can operate but is “very uncomfortable for fast air fighter jets.”           The Canadian air force major said his military’s air crews train on how to respond to such intercepts as occurred on Sunday and will continue to fly over the international waters of the South China Sea.           Asked about the interception at a regular press briefing on Friday, Chinese foreign ministry spokesman Wang Wenbin replied: “I’m not aware of the situation you mentioned.”           “We have reiterated many times our firm position on Canadian warplanes conducting reconnaissance near China’s territorial airspace,” he told reporters. “We hope Canada will refrain from its inappropriate behavior to avoid the situation from becoming more complicated.”           CNN has also reached to China’s Defense Ministry for comment.           China claims historic jurisdiction over almost the entirety of the vast South China Sea, and since 2014 has built up tiny reefs and sandbars into artificial islands heavily fortified with missiles, runways and weapons systems – sparking outcry from the other claimants. The Paracels, called the Xisha Islands by China, are in the northern part of the South China Sea, east of Da Nang, Vietnam, and south of China’s Hainan Island.     Tensions are flaring once more in the South China Sea. Here’s why it matters for the world         The 1.3-million-square-mile waterway is vital to international trade, with an estimated third of global shipping worth trillions of dollars passing through each year. It’s also home to vast fertile fishing grounds upon which many lives and livelihoods depend.           In 2016, an international tribunal in The Hague concluded that China has no legal basis to claim historic rights to the bulk of the South China Sea. China has ignored the ruling.     Major western powers frequently conduct passage across the sea in order to assert that the region is international waters, sparking Beijing’s ire.           The Ottawa had been patrolling the waterway since last Monday, at times operating with United States, Australian, Japanese and New Zealand naval vessels and aircraft in a multinational exercise dubbed Noble Caribou. However, it was operating alone when the encounters with the Chinese jets.           The Ottawa and the US Navy destroyer USS Rafael Peralta overnight Wednesday into Thursday local time continued their deployment into the Taiwan Strait, another international waterway and vital shipping channel that has seen tenseencounters between PLA and allied vessels.           Last June, the US Navy reported a close encounter between the destroyer USS Chung-Hoon and a Chinese warship during a Taiwan Strait transit, in which the US warship slowed down to avoid colliding with the Chinese navy vessel that cut in front of it. The Canadian frigate HMCS Montreal was accompanying the US ship at the time, and a news crew aboard it recorded the incident.           Then Chinese Defense Minister Li Shangfu blamed the US for ratcheting up tensions in the region when questioned by reporters at a defense conference in Singapore.           “They are not here for innocent passage, they are here for provocation,” Li said of US warships.           Li said if the US and other foreign powers did not want confrontation, they should not send their military assets near China.           “Mind your own business,” Li said, adding, “Why did all these incidents happen in areas near China, not in areas near other countries?”           This week’s passage of the allied warships through the strait was uneventful, however, with no contact reported.           Sunday’s incidents come after other reports of unsafe intercepts of allied aircraft in the recent days.           On Tuesday, a PLA fighter jet came within 10 feet of a US Air Force B-52 bomber flying over the South China Sea, the US military said.           And earlier in October, a Chinese fighter jet came within five meters (16 feet) of a Canadian CP-140 reconnaissance and surveillance plane over the East China Sea.           That incident was recorded by news crews aboard the Canadian aircraft and witnessed by Maj. Gen. Iain Huddleston, the commander of Canada’s 1st Air Division, who was also on the plane.           Huddleston called the intercept “unprofessional” and “very aggressive” in a report from Radio Canada, which was on the plane.           “The Canadian aircraft was subject to multiple close-proximity manoeuvres by a PLAAF aircraft that put the safety of all personnel at risk,” Canada’s Defense Ministry said in a statement.     Exclusive: Philippine defense secretary vows to stand up to ‘bully’ China         China’s Foreign Ministry said the Canadian plane illegally entered Chinese airspace and accused the Canadian military of sending “warplanes halfway around the world to stir up trouble and make provocations at China’s doorsteps.”           In February, in an incident witnessed by a CNN crew, a Chinese fighter jet came within 500 feet of a US Navy reconnaissance plane flying at 21,500 feet about 30 miles from the Paracels.           Earlier this month, the Pentagon’s top official in charge of security in the Indo-Pacific, Ely Ratner, said that the US has seen more instances of “coercive and risky” behavior from Chinese pilots against US aircraft in the last two years over the East and South China Seas than in the entire decade before that.           “Since the fall of 2021, we have seen more than 180 such incidents,” Ratner said. “It’s a centralized and concerted campaign to perform these risky behaviors in order to coerce a change in lawful US operational activity.”    © 2023 Cable News Network.

world,Hong Kong is co-hosting the Gay Games. But it faces a backlash from the city’s conservative political elites,https://edition.cnn.com/2023/11/06/asia/hong-kong-asias-first-gay-games-backlash-intl-hnk/index.html,"       The first Gay Games in Asia has faced a political backlash in co-host city Hong Kong after a group of conservative lawmakers called on authorities to scrap the event – and even suggested it could breach a sweeping national security law.           The four-decade old event – which brings both gay and straight athletes around the world to compete in a festival of sport, art and culture – kicked off on Friday with Hong Kong and the Mexican city of Guadalajara as joint hosts.           But there has been vocal opposition from some within the Chinese financial hub’s new “patriots only” political system that was ushered in by Beijing following huge and often violent democracy protests in 2019.           Eight city lawmakers on Wednesday backed a petition from conservative groups calling for the games to be scrapped, accusing the event of advocating for LGBTQ rights and spreading “Western ideology”.           Junius Ho, a firebrand legislator known for both his intense pro-Beijing nationalism and opposition to gay rights, said the petition “objects to any Western ideology that sugar-coated its agenda in the name of diversity and inclusivity for a sports event.”           He also suggested the event could breach provisions within the new national security law that ban foreign powers interfering in Hong Kong’s governance.           “In short, the national security act is the legal basis,” he said.           Another pro-Beijing lawmaker Peter Shiu said the game went beyond an ordinary sports event.           “This is obviously just advocacy. I have no idea how it managed to reach Hong Kong,” he said.           Gay Games organizers hit back at the opposition from Hong Kong lawmakers and have vowed the event will be a proud, non-political, celebration of inclusivity.           “All our books have been checked by professional accountants, open and transparent,” said Lisa Lam, co-chair of Gay Games, at the Hong Kong launch on Thursday adding they had been “abiding by the local laws since Day One.”           They also dismissed concerns that the allegations may deter participants from attending.           “Everyone has their own opinion about things, but we are just about sports and culture,” said Alan Lang, the event’s director of sports.           CNN asked Hong Kong’s government what support it had offered the games and what its views were on those lawmakers who said the event might breach national security rules.           A spokesman did not answer the first part and replied on the latter: “Any activity that takes place in Hong Kong must not contravene any laws of Hong Kong.  Law enforcement agencies will take action if there is any breach of the laws, whether it relates to general offences, crimes or acts endangering national security.”           The rhetoric from pro-Beijing lawmakers comes at a time when the space for China’s LGBTQ community is being increasingly squeezed under Chinese leader Xi Jinping.           Hong Kong does not allow same sex marriage and there is no law banning discrimination on the bases of sexual orientation. But as an international and financial gateway to China, Hong Kong has long had significant and vibrant LGBTQ community.           Multiple government restrictions on same sex equality – including the ban on gay marriage – have been successfully challenged in the court, most recently in September when the city’s top court ordered authorities to come up with some sort of civil partnership alternative for same sex couples.           But the city has also been transformed in the wake of the 2019 protests with Beijing cracking down on pro-democoracy activists using a newly imposed national security law that has criminalized much dissent.     One year after Hong Kong’s national security law, residents feel Beijing’s tightening grip         While the law has not been used to specifically target the LGBTQ community, many of Hong Kong’s prominent democracy activists were vocal supporters of greater equality and have been prosecuted under the sweeping legislation or have fled overseas.           National security offences carry up to life in prison and authorities have broadened powers under the law to seize assets as well as a much higher bail threshold for those arrested.           Beijing also imposed a new political system on Hong Kong whereby anyone standing for elected office or prominent government positions had to be vetted for the patriotism to China and whether they posed any national security risk.           Hong Kong was initially chosen in 2017 as the sole venue for what was supposed to be an event held in 2022. But it had to be postponed for a year because of the city’s strict coronavirus controls at the time, which were in place for far longer than most places around the world.           Guadalajara was then added as a joint host, a first for Latin American, but that has also carried some controversy, with participants raising safety concerns over a location where drug cartel violence is endemic.           According to Reuters, no previous Gay Games has had fewer than 8,000 participants. But a week before the event, only 2,458 participants had registered for Guadalajara and Hong Kong had just 2,381.     Hong Kong’s top court tells government to create ‘legal recognition’ for same-sex partnerships         “In my heart of hearts I wish the whole thing was cancelled and we could skip to Valencia in 2026,” Wayne Morgan, a senior Australian athlete who has competed in six Games already, told Reuters referring to the Spanish host of the next Games.           Taiwan’s athletes explicitly raised Hong Kong’s national security law as a reason they don’t feel safe in going to the city, fearing arrest if they were to wave a Taiwanese flag.           Taiwan’s Gay Sports and Movement Association said their athletes would take part in the Mexican leg instead. Taiwan has a thriving LGBTQ community and in 2019 became the first place in Asia to legalize same sex marriage.           China’s Communist Party claims democratic self-ruled Taiwan as its own territory, despite having never ruled it and have vowed to one day “reunify” it, by force if necessary. Relations between Taiwan and China are at their lowest in decades.           Gay Games organizers have attempted to play down those concerns, saying participants are still coming from all over the world.           “Like the 2,381 athletes (coming to Hong Kong), there are individuals who chose to come and they come from different nationalities, different territories and different countries as well,” said Lang, the director of sports.           Funding for the Gay Games has come mostly from international banks, insurance companies and law firms that have long been calling for greater inclusiveness in the city for their LGBTQ staff. And events are being largely held in private establishments, not Hong Kong’s public sporting venues.           The government was represented by a single official, Regina Ip, at the opening ceremony.           One of Hong Kong leader John Lee’s top advisers and also a lawmaker, Ip has been one of the few Hong Kong politicians vocally supportive of the games.           The event, Ip said, “showcases Hong Kong as an open, inclusive and pluralistic society.”           “The government should have provided more positive publicity on the importance of non-discrimination,” she told CNN.           Meanwhile Chan Kwan-on, one of the Gay Games ambassadors in Hong Kong, urged critics not to jump to conclusions and come see for themselves.           “Come and join us and have a feel.

world,Filipino radio host shot dead while live streaming at his home,https://edition.cnn.com/2023/11/06/asia/philippines-radio-host-juan-jumalon-killed-intl-hnk/index.html,"       A radio host was shot dead while live streaming his program on Facebook at his home in the southern Philippines on Sunday, prompting a hunt for his killers and condemnation from the country’s president.           The broadcaster, Juan Jumalon, also known as “DJ Johnny Walker,” was shot by unidentified assailants in a “brazen killing,” the National Union of Journalists of the Philippines (NUJP) said in a statement on X, formerly Twitter.           “The attack is even more condemnable since it happened at Jumalon’s own home, which also served as the radio station,” it said, adding that Jumalon is the fourth media worker killed since President Ferdinand Marcos Jr. came to power last June.           Jumalon’s broadcasts usually aired on the Facebook page 94.7 Gold Mega Calamba FM, a Visayan-language station with about 2,900 followers. Callers to the show regularly discussed a wide range of topics from relationships to neighborhood issues.           The incident happened at around 5:35 a.m. when the perpetrator entered the station and shot Jumalon in the face, according to a statement from the Misamis Occidental Police Department. He was pronounced dead in hospital, it said.           Sunday’s live stream is no longer on Facebook but video clips of the incident circulating online show Jumalon pausing and looking away from the camera before two apparent gun shots are heard.           Police have identified at least three suspects, including two people who entered the house and a getaway driver, said Captain Diore Libre Ragonio, a police station officer-in-charge, during a press briefing.           Ragonia added that police are investigating potential motives, including whether the attack was related to Jumalon’s broadcast work or personal matters.           President Marcos condemned the attack and said he had ordered the Philippine National Police to thoroughly investigate Jumalon’s death and bring the perpetrators to justice.           “Attacks on journalists will not be tolerated in our democracy, and those who threaten the freedom of the press will face the full consequences of their actions,” Marcos said in a statement on X.           The Philippines, which is known to be one of the world’s most dangerous places for journalists, is ranked 132 of 180 countries on the Reporters Without Borders (RSF) Press Freedom Index.           Misamis Occidental Gov. Henry S. Oaminal said he was shocked at the killing, which he denounced “in the strongest terms” in a statement on Facebook.           “Having known this man as a fearless broadcaster, I share the grief of his family and the people of my province for we lost a truth crusader,” he said.    © 2023 Cable News Network.

world,Danae Netteburg,https://edition.cnn.com/travel/family-seven-hiking-americas-longest-trails/index.html,"       Taking on three of the most remote and rugged long-distance trails of America would be a challenge for any hiker.Taking on three of the most remote and rugged long-distance trails of America would be a challenge for any hiker.           But attempting to hike them with several young children in tow – well that’s a completely different ball game. However, the Netteburgs have managed to do just that.           Made up of Danae and Olen Netteburg, both 44, and their five children Lyol, 14, Zane, 12, Addison, 10, Juniper, eight, and Piper, two, the family of hikers from the US, have just completed North America’s holy hiking trinity, the Triple Crown, which covers almost 8,000 miles (around 12,900 kilometers).           The  Netteburgs, who previously hiked the Appalachian Trail, which stretches over nearly 2,200 miles (3,540 kilometers) between Georgia and Maine, and the Continental Divide Trail, a 3,028-mile (4,873-kilometer) trail extending from New Mexico to the Canadian border in Montana, finished the Pacific Crest Trail in early November.           It took them just under six months to trek the 2,653-mile (4,270-kilometer) trail extending from the border of Mexico through California, Oregon, and Washington to Canada, and the Netteburgs say they feel very lucky to be able to hike these iconic trails as a family.           “We realize, a lot of people can’t do it,” Danae told CNN Travel back in August. “They [either] don’t have the time or money or they don’t want to. So we’re very blessed.”           Danae and Olen, who are both physicians, met at medical school in 2003 and married around three years later.           In 2010, the couple relocated to Chad, a landlocked country in north-central Africa, to run a medical practice and went on to have their children, who were all born in the US.           While the pair had gone on a few backpacking trips together over the years, including a visit to the Canadian Rockies after they got married, it wasn’t until Juniper, their fourth child, was aged around two that they decided to attempt an extensive trail as a family.     This man found love and welcomed a baby during six-year, 8,700-mile hike         “They [the older children] were two, four, six, and nine at the time,” explains Olen. “That summer we did four separate week-long trips – and the kids didn’t hate it. They seemed to enjoy it.           “They liked camping, catching salamanders, campfires and all the rest.”           The first route they tackled was the West Rim Trail, a 30.5-mile (49-kilometer) hike that runs along the western side of the Pennsylvania Grand Canyon.           Feeling encouraged by their children’s enthusiasm, they went on to hike the Uintas Highline Trail, a remote path through the high country of the Uinta Mountains in northeastern Utah.           “That [the Uintas] was high elevation and kind of sketchy weather. So it was sort of a big trip,” adds Olen. “And the kids even enjoyed that one. So we kept doing it.”           After another successful family hike, they decided to “go for broke and do the Appalachian Trail” in early 2020.           “We thought we would just try it for a month to see if we could keep going or if anybody hated it, or whatever,” explains Danae. “We didn’t know how it would go. But it turns out, that was a difficult year for everybody.”           Shortly after they started walking the trail, which stretches along the Appalachian Mountains from Springer Mountain, Georgia, to Mount Katahdin, Maine, the Covid-19 outbreak was declared a global pandemic and restrictions were put in place throughout many countries around the world.           “Various places in America [were] closed in various ways at various times,” says Olen. “So everywhere we would go, we had to make sure that it was legal and safe.”           The Netteburgs admit that they weren’t sure whether they’d be able to finish the challenging trail, but felt more and more confident as time went on and their kids were able to reach certain milestones.     The veteran Black explorer, 78, who’s still on the move         “It was kind of a big moment when the kids did like an 11.3-mile (18.1-kilometer) day,” says Olen.           In order to keep their children motivated, they asked them to strike the pose they wanted to make in the photo that they’d all take once they’d completed the Appalachian Trail, and told them to keep practicing it along the way.           “When you hike with kids, you have to hype it up a lot,” explains Danae.           The couple say it took the six of them around seven months to reach the end of the trail, and by the final week, they were excitedly discussing which journey they’d take on.           “We started reading some articles online to the kids about the Pacific Crest Trail and the Continental Divide Trail,” says Olen.           “And the kids actually started to get kind of excited. And we chose the Continental Divide Trail to be the next one.”           While hikers attempting the Triple Crown tend to do the Pacific Crest Trail after the Appalachian Trail and finish with the Continental Divide Trail, Olen explains that their kids “wanted the hardest one.”           “We figured if we only got to do one more after the AT, we wanted to challenge ourselves,” he adds. “Also, the idea of less crowds appealed to us.”           Although they’d hoped to begin as soon as they could, the Netteburgs had no choice but to put their plans on hold when they discovered that they were expecting their fifth child. Their youngest daughter, Piper, was born in June 2021.           Once things had settled down, they began reading up on “everything about having a baby in the wilderness” in order to be able to take on the Continental Divide Trail with their newborn.           They used elimination communication, the practice of identifying your child’s bathroom cues at an early stage, to toilet train Piper as early as possible.           “A lot of people do it. I just didn’t know about it,” says Danae.           The family also opted to “pare down” their camping equipment in order to make room for all of the extra stuff they’d have to carry, including an extra sleeping bag, as well as “extra clothes and food and all the rest,” now that they had a baby along with them.           “It really added a great deal of complexity into the hike,” says Olen.           They set off with their new addition, who they nicknamed “dead weight,” and the rest of the children in March 2022.     South Africa’s most epic hiking trails         But having to carry a newborn along with them didn’t slow this hiking family down at all.           In fact, they were able to complete Continental Divide Trail in six months, a month less time than the Appalachian Trail had taken them.           “And it was farther too,” says Olen, before noting that they were able to “cover a lot more ground” due to their kids being slightly older this time. “So we went farther and faster.”           Of course, hiking with five children comes with its challenges. The couple use various different tactics to motivate their young ones while on the trail.           For instance, Olen has memorized all of the songs from the soundtrack of Disney’s “Frozen,” and says that  bringing about an impromptu singalong to “Let It Go” while going up a mountain can make all the difference when it comes to how fast the kids are moving.           “Kids really want their parents’ undivided attention,” he notes. “And when you’re hiking, you have the opportunity to do that a lot better. There’s no cell phone signal, there’s no anything else to distract you.”           Once they’d successfully completed the Continental Divide Trail in late 2022, the family were determined to achieve the Triple Crown by hiking the Pacific Crest Trail.           During their first mammoth trails, the couple took sabbaticals from work, while their older children, who are all home-schooled, worked hard to “get ahead” before the trip in order to be able to take the time out.           “Them working very hard in school has made it possible for us to do this,” explains Olen.           But after over a decade working in Chad, Danae and Olen left their medical practice earlier this year to move back to the US full time.           “We’d been there for 12 years, except for the two years that we took a break to do the hikes,” explains Danae. “So it was time for a new person to take over.”           While they plan to settle down and begin making plans for the future at some stage, the family decided to first move ahead with their next big goal – the Pacific Crest Trail.           They started the trail in May, setting off from near Big Bear, California, and made good progress initially.           However, things proved to be incredibly difficult this year due to the amount of snow in California, and the Netteburgs had to move around a lot to avoid the dangerous snow areas.           “They’ve had like more than three times their average snowfall,” explains Olen. “That really threw a massive wrench into things for everybody. Not just for us, but everybody.”           The couple point out that having their kids with them meant that they had to be even more cautious when it came to making decisions about the areas to potentially avoid.           “Our kids are little,” adds Danae. “They’re definitely not fragile. But we have to take care of them.           “So they’re relying on us to not put them in a dangerous situation. And most people just have themselves to worry about.”           When the family met other hikers along the trail, they’d often ask them about their “zero days,” where hikers take a break from walking to do their laundry or stock up on food.           According to Olen, his and Danae’s “zero days” could actually be harder than their hiking days, as they have “all these kids with pent up energy that they have to work out.”           Meanwhile, feeding seven people while on the proved to be pretty costly, while carrying around that much food meant that they had a heavier load.           The family used a mini van, Olen’s dad’s 2014 Dodge Grand Caravan, packed with “over 200 pounds of gear and often several weeks of food,” to move from different hiking areas and arranged for family and/or friends to move it along the trail for them.           Although they’ve received some free or discounted gear from a number of companies, they’ve funded the hikes themselves.           Danae and Olen are incredibly proud of their children, who have learned a great deal from being out in the wilderness.           “We’re seeing animals like bears and moose – I saw a mountain lion,” says Danae. “Just lots of neat things.           “The kids are looking at the trees and the flowers and really studying them, wondering what they are.”           The older children have been listening to classic literature such as Charles Dickens’ “A Tale of Two Cities” and Lucy Maud Montgomery’s “Anne of Green Gables” while hiking, and the family try to fit in regular verbal spelling and math quizzes with the younger ones on the go.           “We’re hoping that the kids take from this, a sense of our family coming closer together,” says Olen.           “And also a sense that no matter what comes, they’ve accomplished a hard thing. And when something seems hard, there’ll be one of the few children to have hiked 7,000 miles.”           On November 4, the family finally reached their finish line, the border of Mexico.           “We’ve all had the best experience,” Danae told CNN Travel shortly after they’d completed the trail.           The Netteburgs have registered their previous hikes with long distance hiking organizations Appalachian Long Distance Hikers Association (ALDHA) and the Continental Divide Trail Coalition (CDTC,) and plan to log their Triple Crowns with American Long Distance Hiking Association-West (ALDHA-West).           They were recently invited to attend next year’s annual ALDHA-West Gathering in recognition of their “crowns.”           Now that they’ve ticked the Triple Crown off their to-do list, Danae and Olen say they’d love to buy a sailboat, or convert a school bus into a motorhome and set off on another adventure with their children.           But for the time being, the family are making the most of not having to walk for miles every day, and hope to pay a visit to Disneyland, as well as catch up with their friends, in the coming days.           Although they have no plans to do another trail for a while, Danae and Olen say they’ve discussed attempting one outside of the US, such as the Camino de Santiago in Spain, or the Tongariro Alpine Crossing in New Zealand.           However, the couple are mindful that their kids will “probably need real school” at some point, and once they both begin working again, they may need to stay in one place, wherever that may be.           “Real life is a bummer,” jokes Olen.    © 2023 Cable News Network.

world,Inside Turkey’s ‘hidden’ ski world,https://edition.cnn.com/travel/article/turkey-heliski/index.html,"   Editor’s Note: This CNN Travel series is, or was, sponsored by the country it highlights. CNN retains full editorial control over subject matter, reporting and frequency of the articles and videos within the sponsorship, in compliance with our policy.         Peering out of the plane window, he spotted the priceless “white gold.” Towering, snow-laden peaks stretching for miles on the southern edge of the Black Sea.           It was as if he could see his future. He knew he’d have to take a closer look.           Swiss mountain guide Thierry Gasser was on his way home from a heli-skiing trip in Kyrgyzstan in 2001, when from his seat he saw the familiar Caucasus mountains to the north and an intriguing chain of shining peaks to the south.           Gazing through “perfect blue skies,” Gasser was looking at the Kaçkar range in northeast Turkey.           “The first look from the plane was perfect, they were huge mountains and a large mountain range – that was the green light for us to go there and check every valley and every mountain,” Gasser tells CNN Travel.           He was already on the lookout for a destination in which to set up his own heli-ski business after years of working around the world as a guide for other operators. He had only three criteria: proximity to Europe to avoid jet lag, a big, high-altitude mountain range, and – ideally – a coastal location for higher snow quantities and a more stable snowpack.           Gasser had spent plenty of time guiding clients in the Russian Caucasus, as well as in Uzbekistan, India, Canada, Alaska and across Europe. A new frontier for heli-skiing was also on the list.          Poring over the maps, Gasser and Italian guiding friend Danilo Garin realised that the 75-mile (121 kilometer) chain of the Kaçkar range, near Turkey’s border with Georgia, seemed to tick all the boxes.           In the summer of 2002, Gasser spent a month on the ground in the area, hiking the valleys, assessing the local facilities and flying over the mountains – the highest of which is Kaçkar Dagi at over 13,000 feet (3,962 meters).           “The shape of the mountains is perfect for heli-skiing,” says Gasser, who is based in Verbier during winter. “In every valley it’s possible to do more than 50 runs if you want and it’s very close to the base – less than five minutes flying. For the guests, it’s perfect.”           He zeroed in on the small resort of Ayder, a traditional “yayla” or summer highland pasture village, with wooden pitch-roof houses and barns, surrounded by pine forests and waterfalls.           The village – in a lush, narrow valley carved by the Firtina river – is popular in summer with regional tourists and visitors from the Middle East with activities such as hot springs, rafting and hiking.           In winter, moist air from the Black Sea mixes with cold mountain air to produce plentiful powder snow at altitude from January to April.           “It’s just epic skiing,” says Oliver Evans of Elemental Adventure, a London-based heli-skiing agency which organizes trips for small groups and private clients to more than a dozen exotic mountain locations worldwide.           “You just don’t realize you’ve got this Canadian-style heli-skiing right on the doorstep of Europe.           “You’ve got these little villages up there which are abandoned in the wintertime with deep snow on the roofs, and mosques. It’s quite exotic to wake up in the morning and hear the call to prayer going on outside the hotel. It’s the last place you expect to be skiing.”           Gasser ran his first trips from Ayder in 2005 with one helicopter, rented from Air Zermatt in Switzerland.           “They opened the road and opened one hotel just for us,” said Gasser.           “We were alone in this village. Now at the weekend plenty of people come there to see the snow, to play in the snow with sledges or with tubing, light a fire or have a barbecue on the snow, with singing and dancing. But when we started, nobody was there in the winter.”           Bureaucracy forced Gasser to shut down the operation after a few years, but he remained eager to return and was able to reopen in 2018, with exclusive access to a nearly 2,000 square mile tenure – enough to fit in a large chunk of the French Alps and some of Italy – reserved for about 20 skiers per week.           In January 2023, with snow in the European Alps thin on the ground and expectations low, Evans flew out to Istanbul and then made the short hop to local airport Rize, just an hour’s drive from Ayder, to run a trip for clients. Trabzon is another regional airport option, two hours’ drive away.           The first day, he says, it was “absolutely dumping.” He took some clients up through the forest in a snowcat to do some avalanche rescue training and assess their ability, skiing back down to the village via a tiny trackside café for a cup of local Turkish tea.           “You’re skiing past, and all these people are looking at you like you’ve come from Mars, they’re not particularly familiar with seeing people skiing there,” says Evans.           The following morning the weather had cleared and Evans, one of the clients, and guides Georg and Yann clambered into the helicopter sitting right outside their hotel base, the three-star Hasimoglu in Ayder.     Turkey’s hidden alpine wonderland         Swiss pilot Dany eased the machine above the frosted trees and out of the valley, opening up a dazzling vista of pristine peaks with the Black Sea glimmering to the north. Minutes later he dropped them at the top of a slope nicknamed Home Run.           “It was a bluebird, not a cloud in the sky, cold, 70-80 centimeters [28-31 inches] of new snow on the base. Just unbelievable,” says Evans.           They waited for the storm of the blades and the wop-wop-wop sound of the heli to disappear. There was a moment’s silence to savor the beckoning slopes beneath them before the guides calmly outlined the plan. None of the frenzy of a resort powder day up here.           “My first turns of the winter and it was thigh-to-waist, light, proper cold-smoke powder,” says Evans.           “The client and I were both giggling like school kids, we just could not believe our luck to have scored it this big on the first day of the season. You could tell even the guides were thinking that this was off the charts.           “There was a lot of whooping and high-fiving going on, it was pretty American. In the first hour and a half I probably skied more untracked powder than I had in the last 10 years.”           After a morning dancing through feathers, they touched down on a ridge for lunch and munched on sandwiches, hot soup, chocolate, fruit and nuts, plus tea, coffee and drinks from the helicopter cool box.           “We were outside this little deserted village with snow folding over the roofs of these little shepherd huts, and the minaret of the mosque just to remind you that you’re in Turkey and not British Columbia,” says Evans. “It was probably my best day’s skiing ever.”           The average run in Ayder is about 900 vertical meters (nearly 3,000 feet) and clients can expect to ski about about 11-15 runs per day. Professionalism and safety are paramount, and the guides are constantly monitoring the avalanche risk.           “There is a misconception about heli-skiing that it’s quite extreme but on the whole, it isn’t,” says Evans. “You’re not jumping out of helicopters; you’re stepping out of them very carefully, slowly and deliberately. There is a saying, ‘slow is fast’. There are a few women doing it but there’s no reason there couldn’t be more.”           Apres ski at the Hasimoglu, which was refurbished in 2016, is generally low key.Guests relax in spring-fed hot baths, sip Turkish coffee or drinks from the bar, play table tennis or visit the on-site masseurs.           Dinner is buffet style with plenty of salads, humus, pitta, falafel, kofte, aubergine, tomatoes and grilled meats. Local specialities include hamsi kusu, a dish of Black Sea anchovies, or muhlama, made of corn flour, butter and cheese.           Gasser’s rotating line-up of guides come from all corners of the globe: Switzerland, France, Italy, Germany, Austria, Sweden, New Zealand, Canada, USA. With the local Turkish staff, it makes for a cosmopolitan mix.           “The Turkish people are very nice, welcoming, very open, they help us a lot, it’s a big pleasure to work with them,” he says.           On bad weather days, alternative activities include skiing from the snowcat, snow shoeing or ski touring. Guests can visit a tea plantation, honey-makers and craft centers, or relax in local restaurants.     The secret side of Turkey’s Aegean coast         When famed American snowboarder Jeremy Jones was a guest, some of the locals revealed they had been riding around the village for more than 60 years on old wooden boards, with rope handles and a stick to steer.           “Maybe snowboarding started there, in a small village in the Kaçkar mountains, not in the USA,” laughs Gasser.  “It’s a great story.”           Progress is in the air in Ayder, and the Turkish government is exploring projects to develop a proper resort with ski lifts. Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdoğan, who hails from Rize, even visited the region in 2020 to promote winter tourism.           The Kaçkar mountains could soon be on the world ski map, and not just for heli-skiing.           “We will be very happy if, one day, there is a ski resort in Ayder,” says Gasser.    © 2023 Cable News Network.

world,Denmark considering a ‘green tax’ on plane ticket prices,https://edition.cnn.com/travel/denmark-green-tax-plane-tickets/index.html,"       Denmark’s government on Thursday proposed imposing an average tax of 100 Danish krone ($14.35) on air travel to help finance a green transition of the airline industry that will enable all domestic flights to use 100% sustainable fuels by 2030.           About half of the expected yearly proceeds of 1.2 billion krone will help finance an ambition of having all domestic flights using only green fuels by the end of the decade, it said. Green technologies such power-to-X, hydrogen and bio fuels will be eligible for state support, it said.           The other half of the proceeds will be used for cash handouts to elderly people, the government said.           Under the proposal by the majority government, the passenger tax will be gradually phased in from 2025. By 2030, the tax will be around $9 for travel inside Europe, $34 for medium-distance flights, and $56 for long-distance.           “The aviation sector in Denmark must – just like all other industries – reduce its climate footprint and move towards a green future,” said Minister for Climate, Energy and Utilities Lars Aagaard in a statement.           The government aims to have the first domestic route using only green fuels in operation by 2025.    © 2023 Cable News Network. A Warner Bros. Discovery Company. All Rights Reserved.

world,Lillian Suwanrumpha/AFP/Getty Images,https://edition.cnn.com/style/miss-universe-owner-bankrupt-pageant/index.html,"       The owner of Miss Universe, JKN Global Group, has confirmed that next week’s pageant will go ahead, despite the Thai firm filing for bankruptcy.           The media distribution company, which bought the Miss Universe Organization for $20 million in 2022, announced on Thursday that it had submitted a petition for “business rehabilitation” that was accepted by Thailand’s bankruptcy court.           In a statement published on its website, JKN said providing a “top notch experience” to Miss Universe fans “will remain a top priority” ahead of next Saturday’s finale. The firm expressed confidence that its new financial arrangements will “support all of the company’s business operations, including Miss Universe.”           Run by Anne Jakkaphong Jakrajutatip, a transgender rights advocate and the star of Thai versions of reality shows such as “Project Runway,” JKN said last year that it planned to grow the Miss Universe Organization by expanding in Asia and releasing branded merchandise.     ‘It’s something essential:’ Inside the exhibition reframing beauty   Declaring bankruptcy does not necessarily mean a company is about to go out of business. Many major firms have used bankruptcy filings as a tool to shed debt and costs they can no longer afford.           JKN, which had raised money through bonds to buy Miss Universe, missed a loan repayment deadline of around $12 million that was due September 1. In its filing, the company said it planned to restructure its debt and extend the repayment period to overcome what it called a “liquidity problem.”           In a press conference at the time, Jakkaphong said market conditions, including high inflation, made it difficult for the firm to roll over its debt.           Jakkaphong, who has been outspoken about her experiences as a trans woman, took over Miss Universe — one of the world’s most-watched beauty pageants — as it reckoned with growing calls for greater diversity and inclusivity.           This year’s pageant will feature two trans women for the first time: Marina Machete, a 23-year-old flight attendant who was crowned Miss Portugal last month, and Rikkie Kollé, who became the first transgender winner of Miss Netherlands in July.         “Trans women are women, full stop,” the Miss Universe Organization told CNN last month, following Miss Portugal’s crowning. “We are here to celebrate women, full stop. This has been true for more than a decade, and we’re proud to have made this change very early on, compared to other programs.”           If either candidate wins, they will become the first trans woman to wear the tiara.

world,A space for humans and pigeons to share is among the highlights of Dubai Design Week,https://edition.cnn.com/style/space-humans-and-pigeons-dubai-design-week-spc/index.html,"   Editor’s Note: This CNN series is, or was, sponsored by the country it highlights. CNN retains full editorial control over subject matter, reporting and frequency of the articles and videos within the sponsorship, in compliance with our policy.         When you think of Dubai, you might picture its iconic skyline and breathtaking architecture. Now, a group of architects and designers is embracing sustainable innovation to create installations that are only a fraction of the size of the city’s soaring towers, but no less inspired.           Among them, Dubai-based Syrian Ahmad Alkattan has created a cocoon-style intimate outdoor social space where designers can “hatch” their ideas. Not only does it offer shade and seating for humans — it also provides shelter to pigeons.           Named “Designest,” it is inspired by the historical significance of pigeon towers in the Arabian Peninsula, where buildings that often featured beautiful arches and detailed engravings were built to protect pigeons during harsh weather and collect their feces for use as fertilizer, as well as showcasing the wealth of the tower’s owner.           Designest features pigeon nests at the top of the oblong structure, while three arched entrances at the bottom welcome human visitors. The sections for humans and pigeons are separated, and bird feces collected from the top section will be used as fertilizer for plants in Dubai’s Design District.           Alkattan’s design is part of the annual Dubai Design Week and won first place in its Urban Commissions competition, which invites designers and architects to develop innovative outdoor furniture. Alkattan said the idea for Designest came from analyzing all the potential users of an outdoor structure in Dubai — not just humans but also the prevalent pigeon population.           “The competition asked to design a shading device, a gathering place or a seating area,” he said. “I tried to do all of that together, but I’ve always had an interest in non-human design, and always thought ‘why does everything need to be human-centric?’”           Now in its ninth year, Dubai Design Week (DDW), which runs from November 7-12, is the largest event of its kind in the region, consisting of workshops, installations, exhibitions and talks. This year, more than 30 designs for installations submitted for DDW have been built in the city’s Design District.           Ahead of the upcoming COP28 climate conference in Dubai, the theme for this year’s design week emphasizes sustainable practices and materials. Mette Degn-Christensen, director of DDW’s flagship design fair Downtown Design, and former director of DDW, said sustainability has been implemented into the event’s design criteria for the past six years, “but this year, it’s really about new forms of sustainable practices, for example not just looking at 3D-printing but also the different kinds of materials you can 3D-print with.”           Alkattan’s Designest structure was originally designed to be 3D-printed using recycled glass fiber reinforced concrete (GFRC), but time, cost and weight constraints meant the prototypes built for DDW use a combination of environmentally friendly methods and materials, including mixing a plant-based plastic alternative with wood powder, and 3D-printing with sand.           “Being environmentally responsible with your design from the very early design stages is no more a niche, it’s more of a necessity,” said Alkattan, who is a freelance concept designer and architect. “That’s why I did my Master’s in renewable energy engineering. It’s not related to architecture, but I wanted to … be aware of how to make my design more sustainable from the early design stages rather than it be an afterthought.”           Other design installations that fit the sustainability theme include Emirati architect Abdalla Almulla’s pavilion “Of Palm,” made entirely from the indigenous palm tree, and Dubai-based architecture and interior design firm TEE VEE EFF’s “Pulp Fractions,” an installation made from waste cardboard and paper pulp that has been pressed, dried, and molded.           “We look for practical designs that are sustainable and scalable across the UAE region,” said Degn-Christensen of the designs that are chosen for DDW. “So [the competition] is a very relevant project not just for what is staged in Dubai Design Week, but where we can see this in the future.”           Designest is Alkattan’s third attempt at winning the Urban Commissions category. “Competitions are the best place to express your ideas without being controlled by the views of your clients or the cost, or the feasibility,” said Alkattan. “It helps to push the boundaries of what is really possible.”    © 2023 Cable News Network.

world,‘Bleu Royal’ diamond fetches almost $44 million at auction,https://edition.cnn.com/style/blue-diamond-christies-royal-sold/index.html,"       The largest internally flawless fancy vivid blue diamond ever put up for auction sold for a staggering $43.8 million at a Christie’s sale of rare jewels in Geneva on Tuesday, the auctioneer said.           The vivid blue diamond, known as “Bleu Royal” and set in a ring, is among the rarest ever to be unearthed. At 17.6 carats, the diamond had an estimated value of up to $50 million prior to the sale.           “The stone made almost $44 million,” said Rahul Kadakia, Christie’s international head of jewelry.           “It’s a huge amount of money given what’s going on in the world today.”           Max Fawcett, head of Christie’s jewelry department in Geneva, said the diamond was unique because of its a deep rich blue color and its unmodified pear brilliant shape.           “It really ticked all the boxes, which is why we managed to excite collectors all around the world, all the way from the Far East, also to America,” he said. “We’re extremely delighted with the result.”           At its auction on Tuesday, Christie’s sold dozens of rare jewelry pieces worth a combined total of more than $77 million.     How 2023 became the year of the lab-grown diamond         “It’s clear that the market is still very strong in certain areas,” Fawcett said.           “Colored stones performed extremely well, as did signed jewelry… There’s a great market out there for rare things, and there are still collectors looking for the very best.”           In a separate sale on Monday, Christie’s sold a Rolex wristwatch worn by Marlon Brando in the 1979 movie “Apocalypse Now” for more than 4.5 million Swiss francs ($4.99 million).           The actor had engraved his signature on the back to avoid having it swapped accidentally during shooting.           Two years ago, that same watch sold at auction for 2 million Swiss francs.    © 2023 Cable News Network. A Warner Bros. Discovery Company. All Rights Reserved.

world,Nicki Minaj makes US Vogue cover debut,https://edition.cnn.com/style/nicki-minaj-vogue-cover-body-positivity-son-name/index.html,"       While she may be promoting her forthcoming studio album “Pink Friday 2,” Nicki Minaj is on the cover of Vogue in cream — a delicately draped Valentino couture gown, that is.           Minaj has previously been featured on the covers of the Arabian and Japanese editions of Vogue (in 2018 and 2019, respectively), but the December issue of US Vogue is marks her stateside debut. It’s a moment that also marks a milestone: after nearly 15 years of dominance in the rap industry, the performer sat down with Vogue to discuss her new album, the pressures of fame and the challenges and joys of raising her 3-year-old son, who she publicly refers to as “Papa Bear.” (Minaj hasn’t otherwise officially revealed her son’s birth name.)           “There’s a freeness that you have around you when you’re at your best, when you’re doing your thing at your peak,” Minaj told the magazine. “But once you start knowing that you’re being judged, there’s no longer that free spirit. People who excel at something make it look easy, but they also deal with a lot of fear of letting people down and letting themselves down. Once you make it, it’s like anything you say can be used against you.”           (Case in point: Minaj spoke briefly about the controversy that ensued in 2021 following a tweet she shared seemingly skeptical of Covid-19 vaccines’ efficacy. “I’m one of those people who doesn’t go with a crowd,” she said, adding, “I like to make my own assessment.”)           It’s also with this perspective — grown out of long being in the public eye, but still wary of it — that Minaj addressed being seen as an emblem of “body positivity” for other women of color with curves, yet not always feeling so positive herself.           “I just looked at a video that I posted on Instagram when I was 25, and I would f**king pay to look like that right now,” Minaj admitted. “But today I can say that I’m at peace with who I am and how I look.”           The rapper also disclosed that she had recently undergone breast reduction surgery, and told Vogue of her new physique that, “actually I love it.”           “I used to want a bigger butt, and now I look back and realize how silly that was,” she said. “Love your curves, and love your non-curves. There’s nothing wrong with any of it.”           “When you look around and try to keep yourself in a grateful frame of mind… the things that you can be thankful for seem to start adding up,” Minaj explained continued. “That’s the thing that’s changed in me. It’s not that I’ve taken these amazing steps. It’s just about finally being happy with who you are as opposed to where you are.”    © 2023 Cable News Network. A Warner Bros. Discovery Company.

world,Mystery of ‘Stick Man’ on Led Zeppelin album cover finally solved,https://edition.cnn.com/2023/11/09/style/led-zeppelin-album-cover-mystery-solved-intl-scli-gbr/index.html,"       After more than half a century, the identity of the elderly, stick-carrying man featured on the “Led Zeppelin IV” album cover has finally been revealed.           The “Stick Man” who featured on the cover of English rock band Led Zeppelin’s 1971 fourth studio album was a thatcher from the late-Victorian era, the Wiltshire Museum in southwestern England said in a statement Wednesday.           The thatcher is thought to be Lot Long – sometimes known as Longyear – who was born in the town of Mere, Wiltshire in 1823 and was a widower living in a small cottage when the photograph was taken. He died in 1893, according to the museum.           Brian Edwards, a visiting research fellow with the Regional History Centre at the University of the West of England (UWE Bristol), made the finding after rediscovering the black and white original photograph, which had “A Wiltshire Thatcher” handwritten on it.           The photograph is thought to be the original because it has a thumb print in the corner, Edwards told BBC Radio Wiltshire on Wednesday.           It was found in a Victorian photo album titled “Reminiscences of a visit to Shaftesbury. Whitsuntide 1892. A present to Auntie from Ernest,” which contained more than 100 architectural views and street scenes, as well as a few portraits of rural workers, according to the museum.           “Led Zeppelin created the soundtrack that has accompanied me since my teenage years, so I really hope the discovery of this Victorian photograph pleases and entertains (surviving band members) Robert, Jimmy, and John Paul,” Edwards said in the release.           The writing in the album matches a partial signature found online, suggesting the picture was taken by the influential Victorian photographer Ernest Howard Farmer, according to Edwards.           According to the university, the colored version of the photograph is understood to have been discovered by the band’s lead singer, Robert Plant, in an antique store near guitarist Jimmy Page’s house in Berkshire, southern England.           This colored version was the only feature on the “Led Zeppelin IV” album cover, which, unusually, had no words on it, not even the band’s name.           Since its release in 1971, more than 37 million copies of the album have been sold worldwide, according to the statement.

The original photograph will be exhibited at Wiltshire Museum next spring, along with others taken in the west of England during the Victorian era.    © 2023 Cable News Network. A Warner Bros.

world,Mario Tama/Getty Images,https://edition.cnn.com/2023/11/03/weather/us-snowfall-maps-el-nino-winter-climate/index.html,"       As the US gears up for a winter heavily influenced by the first strong El Niño in years, scientists at the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration have released maps that offer insight into where snow could pile up.           El Niño – a natural ocean and weather pattern in the tropical Pacific – is forecast to reach the most significant level since a very strong El Niño in 2015-2016 fostered the warmest winter on record across the contiguous US, according to NOAA.           While no two El Niño winters are the same, the pattern typically brings wetter and cooler weather to the southern US while the north becomes drier and warmer. And that’s exactly what’s expected this winter.           However, wetter weather doesn’t necessarily mean more snow. And when it does snow, amounts can vary wildly from one location to the next.     Read More: Forecasters predict a classic El Niño winter this year         This is where the new maps come in. They show where snow is more or less likely during El Niño winters compared to average.           There’s just one caveat: these maps are historical guidebooks, not forecasts, for how the season’s snow could play out. An actual snowfall forecast would account for a variety of atmospheric and climatological factors, not just El Niño.           “El Niño nudges the odds in favor of certain climate outcomes, but never ensures them,” Michelle L’Heureux, one of the two scientists behind the new maps, explained in a NOAA blog post.           The map above depicts how much snow differs from average across all El Niño winters, regardless of El Niño’s strength. The drier trend that’s typical across the northern US shows up well in the tan and brown shading, while the wetter, snowier trend across the southern US appears in the blue shading.           This pattern comes from the jet stream’s shift south, pushing storms across the southern tier of the country at the expense of the north. And an increase in storms during the winter means snow is more likely.           The stronger an El Niño is, the more amplified its impact becomes. The map below shows the same data for stronger El Niño winters. The pronounced darker hues represent more extreme shifts in snowfall during a strong El Niño compared to an average one.           The big snow winners are the mid-Atlantic, the high elevations of the Southwest and California, and the South, albeit with an important caveat.           It still needs to be cold in order to snow, so chances don’t vary as much from normal in portions of Texas and the Southeast, which tend to remain too warm for flakes to fly.           El Niño’s jet stream effect is particularly noticeable in the highest terrain of the West, where cold and snow isn’t usually hard to come by. Mountains in the Southwest and California thrive while the Northwest misses out because of fewer storms.           Storms that affect the mid-Atlantic’s snow chances typically take a track along the spine of the Appalachians or push off the coast and become nor’easters.           These nor’easters can get “juiced up” by abundant tropical moisture during El Niño and deliver “two to three big snowstorms” on average, according to Jon Gottschalck, chief of the Operational Prediction Branch of NOAA’s Climate Prediction Center.           This could bring above-average snowfall to places like Washington, DC, and Baltimore, where less than an inch fell last winter.           Even though the Northeast typically misses out on snow during a strong El Niño winter, all it takes is one massive storm, like a “juiced up” nor’easter, to skew snow totals for the whole season.           Snow lovers in the Northwest and Midwest will also have to join their Northeast counterparts in hoping for a big storm. Stronger El Niños have caused less snow than average in the past.           Removing snowfall totals from the map and focusing on the number of stronger El Niños with below-average snowfall helps suss out outlier storms.           On the map above, darker reds indicate areas that have experienced more years of below-average snowfall during moderate-to-strong El Niño winters.           Parts of the typically snowy Midwest and Northeast which also suffer from snowfall deficits jump out clearly, a sign that this may be where El Niño steals the most snow, most often.    © 2023 Cable News Network.

world,"Storm Ciarán batters Northwest Europe, killing at least 4 people and cutting 1 million off power grids",https://edition.cnn.com/2023/11/02/weather/storm-ciaran-france-uk-electricity-northwestern-europe-climate-gbr-intl/index.html,"       ﻿Storm Ciarán has brought hurricane-strength winds to France, the Channel Islands and southern England, leaving more than a million people without access to electricity and forcing hundreds of schools to close.           The storm has claimed at least four lives, two in France and a further two in Belgium.           In France, 1.2 million people were left without power as winds of over 120 kph (75 mph), and gusts of more than 200 kph (124 mph) hit the department of Finistère in the northwest, according to the country’s meteorological agency Meteo-France. The wind speeds broke several local records.           “The very violent winds and gusts which followed one another throughout the night had the effect of causing many trees, branches and electrical and telephone lines across the entire road network to fall to the ground,” a statement from the Finistère government said.           Around 780,000 of those without power are in the northwestern region of Brittany, French energy supplier Enedis said in a statement. Fallen trees and electricity pylons uprooted by the storm were to blame for the cuts. Enedis has mobilized around 3,000 workers and 30 helicopters to re-establish power to affected areas.           A truck driver was killed after being hit by a falling branch while driving, according to the French Transport Minister Clément Beaune in an interview with French broadcaster Franceinfo. The second victim was a 70 year-old man died in Le Havre after falling while attempting to close his balcony shutters, according to France’s interior ministry.           Meanwhile, in Belgium, a 65-year-old woman and a 5-year-old child were killed in Ghent after being hit by branches in two separate incidents, the East Flanders public prosecutor’s office said in a statement.           The storm has also hit the British Isles and Channel Islands, where red alert warnings are in place. On the island of Jersey, all schools and the airport were closed, according to the government’s website. In the southwestern county of Cornwall, 8,500 people were without power, the local council said on X (formerly Twitter), trees were blocking dozens of roads, and more than 100 schools were closed. Local media images showed waves crashing into and breaching sea walls in the southwestern English county of Cornwall.           The UK’s Met Office has warned that the combination of strong winds and rain posed a “danger to life” from flying debris, as trees and homes are expected to suffer damage. Large waves could damage coastal roads and properties.           Disruption to travel is expected. Several rail companies have warned people not to commute, even in the capital, although the Met Office said late Thursday morning that the storm’s path had moved further south than earlier projections showed. The strongest winds will likely be confined to areas closest to the coast, it said.          Storm Ciarán follows less than two weeks after Storm Babet, which brought strong winds, heavy rainfall and flash flooding to parts of Scotland and northern and central England, killing several people.           The human-induced climate crisis is making some storms more frequent and intense. As the Earth’s atmosphere warms, it is able to hold more water vapor — so when it rains, it rains much more intensely.           “There are a lot of attribution studies and other lines of evidence showing that autumn/winter storms like this are more damaging because of climate change,” said Friederike Otto, senior lecturer in climate science at the Grantham Institute, Imperial College London. “The rainfall associated with these types of storms is more severe due to climate change, and the storm surges are higher and thus more damaging due to the higher sea levels.”     CNN’s Angela Dewan, Pierre Bairin, James Frater and Eve Brennan contributed to this report.   © 2023 Cable News Network.

world,Thousands flee Highland Fire in California as hot and dry Santa Ana winds stoke the flames,https://edition.cnn.com/2023/10/31/weather/highland-fire-california-santa-ana-climate/index.html,"       A vegetation fire in California’s Riverside County exploded in size as it was stoked by hot and dry Santa Ana winds, scorching multiple structures and forcing thousands of people to flee their homes.           When the fire – dubbed the Highland Fire – was first reported Monday at 12:37 p.m. PDT, near Aguanga, California, it was only 14 acres in size. Just seven hours later, the fire had grown to more than 1,200 acres, according to Cal Fire.           As of early Tuesday morning, the Highland Fire had charred 2,200 acres and was 0% contained, Cal Fire reported﻿. It has destroyed at least three structures and damaged six others.           Evacuation orders were first issued Monday afternoon but were quickly expanded Monday evening and then again on Tuesday morning.           More than 1,100 homes have been evacuated in the area of the fire, affecting approximately 4,000 people, Riverside Fire spokesperson Maggie Cline De La Rosa told CNN. Another 1,700 people have been warned that they might also have to evacuate.           The evacuation orders and warnings – the latter of which are meant to warn residents to prepare for an evacuation order – are still active.     See a map of the evacuations here         Sustained wind speeds of 20 to 25 mph with gusts up to 35 mph are forecast in and around the area of the Highland Fire on Tuesday, according to the National Weather Service. These winds will continue to challenge firefighters and could further increase the size of the fire.           At least 310 firefighters from 49 engine companies were responding to the fire as of Tuesday morning, according to Cal Fire.           The cause of the fire is under investigation.           While its origin remains unclear, it is not a mystery how the Highland Fire was able to grow so quickly. Extremely dry air and strong winds in California on Monday and Tuesday combined to fuel rapid fire spread.     Wildfires are dealing a massive blow to US real estate and homeownership, congressional report finds         Relative humidity – a measure of how much moisture is in the air – was very low on Monday: around 5% to 15%, according to a forecast discussion from the National Weather Service in San Diego. When relative humidity decreases, fires are easily triggered and sustained.           Once fires form, gusty winds cause these fires to spread quickly and even blow their embers into the distance to start additional fires. Winds gusted over 50 mph near the fire, driven by a Santa Ana event which began over the weekend across parts of Southern California.           Santa Ana winds, nicknamed for the Southern California mountain range, are seasonal hot and dry winds that develop when air flows from east to west — something it’s prone to do there in the fall and winter.           As air travels from the high elevation of the mountains down to sea level, it is compressed by higher pressure, which heats it up and dries it out. Santa Ana winds can become quite strong as they rush down mountains, enhanced by canyons and passes that act as natural wind tunnels. The winds can dry out vegetation, making it more fire prone, and fan the flames of existing fires.           California wildfires have been pacing well-below average so far this year, with over 315,000 acres burned as of October 31. Typically, fires have scorched 1.5 million acres of California by this point in the year, according to CAL FIRE.     CNN’s Cheri Mossburg contributed to this story  © 2023 Cable News Network.

world,Where trick-or-treaters will face snow or chilling temperatures this Halloween,https://edition.cnn.com/2023/10/31/weather/halloween-weather-trick-or-treat-forecast/index.html,"       Millions of trick-or-treaters across the US will be reaching for extra layers, not umbrellas, this Halloween as temperatures fall to “scary” levels for October.           Much of the contiguous US will remain dry as people go door-to-door Tuesday evening in search of candy, with a couple of exceptions.           A storm off the mid-Atlantic coast will bring showers from the Carolinas to southern New Jersey just in time for trick-or-treating Tuesday evening.     Check your local forecast here         A few snow showers will also spread across portions of the Great Lakes on Tuesday. Flakes began to fall early Tuesday morning across portions of Wisconsin and Illinois and will spread east into parts of Michigan, Indiana and Ohio by Tuesday night. The first snow of the season could arrive in Chicago on Tuesday, but very little accumulation is expected.           Conditions across the rest of the US will range from chilly to downright cold by Tuesday evening with about 120 million people under freeze watches and warnings.           A shot of bone-chilling air plunged south out of Canada early this week and overspread much of the US early Tuesday, sending temperatures plummeting by as much as 30 degrees and making it feel more like December than October.           High temperatures for much of the East and parts of the South on Tuesday will fall nearly 10 degrees short of what’s normal for the end of October. It’ll feel more like early December from Burlington, Vermont, to Atlanta.           Philadelphia and Washington, DC, climbed solidly into the 80s over the weekend but will struggle to make it out of the low 50s by Tuesday afternoon and drop into the upper 40s by late Tuesday evening.           Portions of the West Coast and Florida will be the only areas of the contiguous US to avoid goosebumps on Halloween.           In Dallas, the high temperature will be in the 50s on Tuesday – nearly 20 degrees below normal – and will feel more like late December than October. Any trick-or-treaters out on Tuesday evening will need to bundle up as temperatures fall into the 40s.           Temperatures in the Rockies will begin a slow rebound on Tuesday from the weekend’s teeth-chattering cold, but conditions will generally remain quite chilly for late October.           Just like a carved pumpkin, this cold won’t last forever. Chilly air will persist across the northern tier of the US for much of the week, but the South and much of the central US will trend back toward normal before the weekend.    © 2023 Cable News Network.

world,Chainwit./Wikimedia Commons,https://edition.cnn.com/style/thailand-robot-building-renovation-bangkok/index.html,"       For almost four decades, its cartoonish eyes gazed out placidly over Sathorn, a commercial district in downtown Bangkok. Now, with its facade stripped back to a concrete frame amid major renovations, the tower affectionately known as the “Robot Building” is barely recognizable, save for its characteristically blocky silhouette.           The building’s owners, the Thai arm of Singapore’s United Overseas Bank (UOB), say the refurbishment will make its headquarters more energy-efficient and employee-friendly. While the company would not share images of the proposed redesign with CNN, conservationists and architects — including the tower’s 84-year-old designer, who says he was shown plans for the new exterior — have expressed dismay at dramatic alterations being made to an icon of Southeast Asian postmodernism.           Completed in 1986, the Robot Building was intended to reflect changes in the banking industry, which at the time was embracing new computer technology. Its designer Sumet Jumsai, who was inspired by one of his son’s toy robots, is considered a major figure in contemporary Thai architecture, and was named a “national artist” by the country’s government.           In an email to CNN, Sumet, who is now retired, decried the “defacement” of his creation. He described renovations as a “devastating statement” demonstrating the “ignorance and arrogance (of) big corporations.”           In March, the architect wrote to UOB Thailand expressing concern over the loss of the tower’s “original iconic features,” including its eyes, and urging it to reconsider plans “before it is too late.” The bank’s response, which was shared with CNN by Sumet, acknowledged that the building was a “significant landmark” — but said the planned refurbishment would bring it “into a new era while paying homage to its heritage.”           The bank added that it will keep a replica of the building’s original form in “a corner of the lobby.”           Originally designed for the Bank of Asia, the tower was acquired by UOB Thailand in 2005. The firm told CNN, via email, that its renovations are focused on “promoting environmental sustainability” and “enhancing employee well-being” for the thousands of workers who will occupy the building upon its reopening in 2025.     Bangkok’s abandoned ‘ghost’ towers still stand 20 years after crash         The organization said its redesign will reduce electricity consumption by at least 15%, with a new glass exterior “minimizing the need for artificial lighting and thus reducing associated… carbon emissions.”           Standing 20 stories high, the Robot Building’s floors get progressively smaller as they rise, giving the structure its distinctive staggered shape. Its iconic lidded “eyes” served as windows for two executive suites on the upper floors, while the building’s toy-like appearance was completed by antennas — used for communications and as lightning rods — and a series of large metallic nuts decorating its sides.           The Robot Building is among a vanishingly small number of landmarks from the era to have survived Bangkok’s breakneck urban development. After recovering from the 1997 Asian financial crisis, Thailand’s capital experienced a building boom that transformed areas like Sathorn. Bangkok is now the world’s 14th tallest city, with 112 towers measuring 150 meters (492 feet) or above, according to the Council on Tall Buildings and Urban Habitat (CTBUH).           The Thai branch of Docomomo International, a non-profit dedicated to preserving modern architecture, said it has identified the relatively diminutive Robot Building in its upcoming list of the country’s 20 “most outstanding” structures.           In an open letter to UOB Thailand, published in April, the conservation group’s president, Pongkwan Lassus, described the Robot Building as an “historical marker” signaling the transition from late modernism to postmodernism — an architectural movement known for decorative facades, ornamentation and a rejection of the mid-century mantra “form follows function.”           Bangkok-based filmmaker Dana Blouin, who is producing an as-yet-unnamed documentary on the Robot Building, said that despite campaigners’ pleas, the tower has now “lost its soul.”     Tokyo’s iconic Nakagin Capsule Tower to be demolished         “We’ve lost something that was probably more important than anyone realized,” he told CNN via video call.           While recognizing the tower may have been viewed as a “novelty,” Blouin said the original design “felt elevated and refined.” He added: “It was still fun, and it was still whimsical. And it was beautiful.”           “When it was built, it was one of the tallest buildings (in Sathorn district),” he said. “Today, the structure is minuscule by comparison — it’s dwarfed by these other glass and steel structures all around it. And that made it all the more special.”           The filmmaker’s affection may not be shared by many in Bangkok. A petition, started in April by campaign groups including Docomomo, had attracted fewer than 1,700 signatures at the time of writing.           Thailand’s conservation efforts and laws, meanwhile, are mostly directed towards the country’s ancient heritage. Campaigners and architects hope that, while it may be too late for the Robot Building, other important examples of contemporary architecture may be spared a similar fate.           “After nearly two decades of effort, we are beginning to see a shift from the government sector,” reads Pongkwan’s letter to UOB Thailand.           For Blouin, a wider cultural shift is needed if other modern Bangkok landmarks are to be preserved. “The embrace of newness… has led to the forgetting of some of these icons,” he said. “And that’s unfortunate.”       CNN’s Kocha Olarn contributed to this story.  © 2023 Cable News Network.

In an open letter to UOB Thailand, published in April, the conservation group’s president, Pongkwan Lassus, described the Robot Building as an “historical marker” signaling the transition from late modernism to postmodernism — an architectural movement known for decorative facades, ornamentation and a rejection of the mid-century mantra “form follows function.”           Bangkok-based filmmaker Dana Blouin, who is producing an as-yet-unnamed documentary on the Robot Building, said that despite campaigners’ pleas, the tower has now “lost its soul.”     Tokyo’s iconic Nakagin Capsule Tower to be demolished         “We’ve lost something that was probably more important than anyone realized,” he told CNN via video call.           While recognizing the tower may have been viewed as a “novelty,” Blouin said the original design “felt elevated and refined.” He added: “It was still fun, and it was still whimsical. And it was beautiful.”           “When it was built, it was one of the tallest buildings (in Sathorn district),” he said. “Today, the structure is minuscule by comparison — it’s dwarfed by these other glass and steel structures all around it. And that made it all the more special.”           The filmmaker’s affection may not be shared by many in Bangkok. A petition, started in April by campaign groups including Docomomo, had attracted fewer than 1,700 signatures at the time of writing.           Thailand’s conservation efforts and laws, meanwhile, are mostly directed towards the country’s ancient heritage. Campaigners and architects hope that, while it may be too late for the Robot Building, other important examples of contemporary architecture may be spared a similar fate.           “After nearly two decades of effort, we are beginning to see a shift from the government sector,” reads Pongkwan’s letter to UOB Thailand.           For Blouin, a wider cultural shift is needed if other modern Bangkok landmarks are to be preserved. “The embrace of newness… has led to the forgetting of some of these icons,” he said. “And that’s unfortunate.”       CNN’s Kocha Olarn contributed to this story.  © 2023 Cable News Network.

world,This massive ‘floating’ museum is straight out of science fiction,https://edition.cnn.com/2023/10/30/style/chengdu-science-fiction-museum-hnk-spc-intl/index.html,"       The seven-point metallic star floats on the glassy surface of the lake, reminiscent of a far-flung future civilization, or a spaceship touching down on an alien planet. It looks like something straight out of science fiction. Which it is, in a way: it’s the brand new Chengdu Science Fiction Museum in the capital of Sichuan province in Southwest China.           From one side, the dynamic roof mimics the sloping mountains in the distance; from another, the canopy takes on the appearance of a cloud, its cantilever arches suspended above seamless panes of glass.           “From every angle, it will always look different; it will always look unusual or unexpected,” said Paulo Flores, one of the project directors at Zaha Hadid Architects, which designed the museum.           Perhaps more unexpected than the design itself is the time it took to build.           The museum was commissioned in 2022 to host this year’s 81st annual World Science Fiction Convention, nicknamed Worldcon. A building of this size and complexity would typically take four to five years to build, says Flores. But the 59,000 square-meter building — which is three times the size of the Sydney Opera House — went from concept to completion in just 12 months.           But despite the tight turnaround for Flores and his team, it was the dream assignment. “Science fiction has always been a very important source of inspiration for our designs,” said Flores. “Science fiction has always taken that leap forward, looking at what technology is currently and what technology could evolve into.           “We want to be part of that movement of creating what the future looks like — not only visually, but also technologically.”           The London-based architecture firm is no stranger to technology. The firm’s namesake, Zaha Hadid, was a pioneer in digital design, and the tools she used enabled her to create dynamic, futuristic buildings.           “We can only create these types of geometries using polygonal modeling software,” explained Flores, which creates a “three-dimensional simulation of the building.”         With this project, the technology was not only key to creating an ambitious design, but also executing it rapidly. Just two weeks after the firm won the competition, construction on the project began.           Using a variety of design software, including digital modeling analysis, the team was able to accelerate the timeline, and ensure that everyone, from architects to materials manufacturers to construction workers, was on the same page.           Satoshi Ohashi, another one of the project directors, said that construction and design happening in parallel “could not have been done without these new tools.”           Ohashi added that the digital modeling analysis allowed the team to optimize the building’s structure for Chengdu’s climate. By analyzing weather and environmental parameters, the software informed decisions about the size and angle of the roof overhang to protect interiors from direct sunlight.     ‘World’s first off-road solar SUV’ just drove across Morocco powered only by the sun         Green tech is integrated to minimize the building’s operating impact, too, with solar panels embedded into the expansive roof to help power the building, and skylights and floor-to-ceiling windows to reduce the need for artificial light during the day.           The team also had to source materials locally to save time and come up with simple ways of making their concept a reality. For example, they created a modular aluminum panel system that sits “underneath the skin” of the roof canopy, which creates “smooth and seamless” curves while also making it quick to produce in a factory, said Ohashi.           Already home to more than 20 million residents — and growing — Chengdu has rapidly expanded in the last few decades.           Earlier this year, the city topped China’s new first-tier cities list, which ranks metropolises based on factors like resident lifestyle, commercial opportunities, and transport.         The Science Fiction Museum is part of a larger “Future City” development in the Pidu district, outside of the city. Known as Chengdu Future Science and Technology City, the 4.6-square-kilometer (1.8-square-mile) site will house multiple new universities, laboratories and offices.           “Part of that growth is also this attention to the future, science and technology, integrating that into the city, and growing that economy,” Ohashi explained.           The nation’s multi-billion dollar “science fiction industry” includes publishing and film releases, with Chengdu at the center. Chengdu is also the birthplace of Science Fiction World, one of the world’s most-read sci-fi magazines, which was founded in the city in 1979.         The museum opened on schedule to host its inaugural event — the first time Worldcon has been hosted in China, and only the second time in Asia. Dave McCarty, vice-chair of Chengdu Worldcon and an organizer with the event for two decades, described the museum as “the best facility by far that the Worldcon has ever been hosted in,” and said having a purpose-built location made the event feel more special compared to hosting it in “cookie-cutter” convention centers.     ‘Houses That Can Save the World’: These homes offer a blueprint for a greener future         “Having that dedicated space makes a wonderful home for science fiction,” McCarty added.           With its successful bid to host the 81st Worldcon, Ohashi hopes that the new museum and event space can become “an iconic landmark that will represent their science fiction industry” and will nurture the ambitions of the burgeoning “Future City.”           “They can now say that they are China’s science fiction capital,” he said.    © 2023 Cable News Network.

world,"Skeletons unearthed in ‘incredibly rare’ 5,000-year-old Scottish tomb",https://edition.cnn.com/style/article/tomb-neolithic-skeletons-intl-scli-scn/index.html,"       The ruins of an “incredibly rare” 5,000-year-old tomb have been uncovered on one of the Scottish Orkney Islands, National Museums Scotland said in a statement on Tuesday.            The excavation at Holm, East Mainland, Orkney, revealed a stone structure accessed through a 7-meter (23-foot) -long passage and traces of a cairn – or pile of stones – that would have covered it, representing the “pinnacle of Neolithic engineering in northern Britain,” the statement said.           Fourteen articulated skeletons of men, women and children, as well as other human remains, were discovered in one of the six smaller side cells that surrounded a large stone chamber.            “In the Neolithic, it would have been an incredibly impressive 15 meter diameter, enormous mound, very substantial stonework, very impressive architecture. Those cells are real feats of engineering,” Hugo Anderson-Whymark, one of the excavation’s co-directors and senior curator of prehistory (Neolithic) at National Museums Scotland, told CNN.     2,300-year-old tomb found in Israel may contain remains of Greek courtesan         Two of the skeletons had been positioned so that they were almost embracing against each other, with two children placed over their heads, Anderson-Whymark said. However, archaeologists have not yet determined the relationships between these individuals.           “The preservation of so many human remains in one part of the monument is amazing, especially since the stone has been mostly robbed for building material,” archaeologist Vicki Cummings, head of the School of History, Archaeology and Religion at Cardiff University, who co-directed the excavation, said in a statement.            “It is incredibly rare to find these tomb deposits, even in well-preserved chambered tombs and these remains will enable new insights into all aspects of these peoples’ lives,” she added.           Only 12 other similar tombs are known to exist in Orkney, referred to as Maes Howe-type passage graves. Most of these remain visible in the landscape – unlike this latest discovery which was buried below ground.           It was largely destroyed in the late 18th or early 19th century to provide stone for building a farmhouse, according to the statement, but later rudimentary excavations in 1896 uncovered eight skeletons and prompted local antiquary James Walls Cursiter to hypothesize that it was a ruined tomb.           Papers held in a private collection of Curister’s notes contained more clues that allowed archaeologists to undertake a geophysical survey in the hope of pinpointing the potential tomb, and provide the basis for the excavation.           “It was quite a surprise to make that discovery,” Anderson-Whymark said. “It’s such a big thing but yet today it’s just a gently rolling field of grass. There’s nothing on the surface to suggest this tomb ever existed there but it would have once been an incredible monument. We’re fortunate they’ve left us just enough of it.”     Sign up for CNN’s Wonder Theory science newsletter.

world,See inside the $50M penthouse that will crown the Waldorf Astoria Miami,https://edition.cnn.com/style/waldorf-astoria-miami-penthouse-apartment/index.html,"       The developers behind Miami’s glittering Waldorf Astoria supertall have unveiled the first look at the 1,049-foot tower’s $50 million penthouse, one of the most expensive units to come to market in the city.           The six-bedroom, nine-bathroom property — which spans some 13,000 square feet — will sit at the top of the nine stacked cubes that make up the vertiginous building, situated on a waterfront stretch in downtown Miami. It’s currently slated to be completed in 2027 by architect Carlos Ott and the firm Sieger Suarez.           Renderings of the penthouse’s interior — designed by the firm BAMO — showcase a modern, airy unit with wraparound windows, enclosed balconies, recessed lighting and luxe marble finishes. Rooms include a private gym, spa, library and theater.           And, when it’s completed, the penthouse will stand out in Miami’s (currently) unobstructed sky. Though a number of skyscrapers are being built or have been proposed in the South Florida metropolis, the Waldorf Astoria Miami hopes to top out first.           “Even with the great skyscrapers of the world — in Dubai, Hong Kong, New York — there’s a lot of towers,” said Ryan Shear, managing partner of the building’s developer, PMG. With the Waldorf Astoria Miami, he continued, “you get to be on top of a world-class city.”     Inside the ‘Bentley’ of luxury residential towers, opening in Miami         With that in mind, the team at BAMO worked with the theme of “transcendence” as they envisioned the building’s interiors, explained principal designer Anne Wilkinson, which include the shared amenities of the building’s 460 residences and 205 hotel rooms and suites.           The Waldorf Astoria brand is known for its mainstays: a grand clock in every location, for example, as well as Peacock Alley, a lounge in the historic New York hotel that has since been replicated in its other properties. In Miami, these spaces are meant to evoke a sense of wonder, with Peacock Alley becoming a “conservatory” in the sky, she said, with sweeping views from three sides on the 19th and 20th floors.           On those floors, the building’s version of a signature clock is a three-story pendulum that Wilkinson says no other Waldorf Astoria location “has ever attempted.” From at the building’s restaurant on the 21st floor, the pendulum swings down to Peacock Alley, nearly sweeping its 19th floor at just 3 feet off the ground.           In the penthouse, Wilkinson said their team took inspiration from the exterior’s geometric architecture in the palette of surfaces and finishings.           “(Carlos Ott) described the skin of the building as this reflective surface… you can imagine every facet of those cubes reflecting a different part of the sky,” she said. “I thought that was such a beautiful notion, so we pulled it into the interior. A lot of our colors are these ethereal grays and blues, and even shifting into nighttime inky colors.”           Though the original Waldorf Astoria on New York’s Fifth Avenue is best-known for its ornamental Art Deco architecture, Wilkinson believes the clean lines of the Miami iteration and its sky-high penthouse fit well within its legacy.           “If you remember back when Waldorf was originally built, Art Deco was quite avant garde,” she said. “And so to me, I think Waldorf is more about being forward-looking. It’s about the design of the moment.”    © 2023 Cable News Network. A Warner Bros. Discovery Company. All Rights Reserved.  CNN Sans ™ & © 2016 Cable News Network."
world,Sydney Opera House at 50: See what Australia’s best-known building could have looked like,https://edition.cnn.com/style/sydney-opera-house-competition-designs/index.html,"       On October 20, 1973 — exactly 50 years ago this Friday — the Sydney Opera House was opened to great fanfare by the late Queen Elizabeth II.           Completed a decade late and vastly over-budget, the unusual-looking building was not an immediate hit with Australians. Yet, in the decades since, its striking shell-shaped roof helped it become an architectural icon and an UNESCO World Heritage Site that attracts over 10 million visitors a year.           How different things might have been.           Danish architect Jørn Utzon’s successful proposal was just one of 233 entries in an international design competition. Launched in 1955 by New South Wales premier Joseph Cahill, who was a long-time advocate of transforming the site of an old tram depot into an opera house, the contest attracted participants from over 30 different counties.           A document outlining the competition criteria, known as the “Brown Book,” described certain architectural requirements: The building would, for instance, need a main hall capable of accommodating 3,000 to 3,500 people (though the final building has a capacity of under 2,700) and parking space for 100 cars. The document also addressed issues like ventilation and exit passageways. But, otherwise, designers were encouraged to indulge their imaginations — with organizers setting no limit for how much money proposals might cost to realize.           Entrants were asked only for black and white drawings, including floor plans and diagrams, as well as a report that “should be as concise as possible, explaining only matters which cannot be readily explained on the drawings,” the Brown Book reads. So, in 2019, creative studio NeoMam Studios and now-defunct architecture firm Projection Comunicación Arquitectónica set about researching the entries and visualizing, in full color, how some of the proposals might have looked.           They picked seven from the 232 unsuccessful entries — a selection process based both on the merits of the submissions and the amount of information available to researchers.           “Some of them had a story, some of them were ones we knew we could do a good job with, and some were ones where we thought, ‘It would have been hilarious if they’d chosen something like this,’” NeoMam Studios’ CEO, Gisele Navarro, recalled in a phone interview with CNN.           And while Navarro concludes that competition judges ultimately “made the right choice,” she applauded some of the entrants’ “blue-sky thinking.”           Quite how close any of these alternatives came to winning may be lost to history. But legend has it that Utzon’s winning design was initially dismissed, only to be saved from the reject pile by Finnish American architect Eero Saarinen, one of the judges.

world,"Liverpool loses in Europa League after controversial VAR decision, as Jurgen Klopp left angered by press conference",https://edition.cnn.com/2023/11/10/sport/liverpool-europa-league-jurgen-klopp-var-spt-intl/index.html,"       Another game and yet another controversial video assistant referee (VAR) decision.           This time, it was Liverpool which was denied a last-minute equalizer in its Europa League group stage match against Toulouse on Thursday, after Jarell Quansah’s goal to make it 3-3 was ruled out.     Spoiler alert: VAR is proving to be box office entertainment in the Premier League – but at what cost to the action?         The young defender had seemingly rescued a point for the visitors in the seventh minute of added time, but his effort was eventually ruled out for handball in the buildup.           The game, which finished 3-2 to Toulouse, was plunged into confusion as the on-field referee, Georgi Kabakov, appeared to initially give the goal, before reversing his decision and going to check the replay monitors at the side of the pitch.           After reviewing the footage, he ruled the goal out, judging that Liverpool’s Alexis Mac Allister handled the ball 14 seconds before the goal went in.           The decision sent Stadium TFC into a frenzy, leaving Le Téfécé celebrating a famous win and Liverpool players incensed.           “We scored a third goal, I think it’s a goal, 100%. I’m not even sure the ball touches the hand at all, but that’s how it is,” Liverpool manager Jurgen Klopp told TNT Sports after the match.           Match footage shows that the ball came off Mac Allister’s chest and onto his arm as he tried to control a clearance. Liverpool then started another attack, with Toulouse unable to clear the ball on a number of occasions before Quansah’s shot found the back of the net.           Despite the controversial ending, Klopp acknowledged his team had not been good enough and had made too many “mistakes.”           “We weren’t aggressive enough. They [Toulouse] won all the decisive battles and challenges. We gave balls easily away,” a frustrated Klopp told reporters after the match.           “With all the possession, obviously, we should have created more and could have created more.           “You cannot concede three goals here tonight. That makes no sense, but because they fought harder, they were more aggressive in the challenges, it’s deserved. Congratulations to Toulouse.”           Toulouse had gone 2-0 up in the match, courtesy of goals from Aron Dønnum and Thijs Dallinga, before Liverpool halved the deficit through an own-goal by Cristian Cásseres Jr.           The home side, which had two other goals ruled out by VAR during the game, then re-established a two-goal cushion through Frank Magri.           Liverpool’s Diogo Jota finished off a brilliant solo run in the 89th minute to set up a tense conclusion to the match, which eventually ended in the VAR controversy.           The win for Toulouse moves it to second in Group E, with Liverpool still top having won its previous three matches in the competition.           The night only got worse for Klopp, though, with the manager furious about the organization of his post-match press conference.           Toulouse fans could be heard singing and playing drums near where Klopp was speaking to reporters, making it hard for the already irritated manager to hear the questions.           “Who had the idea to do the press conference here? That would be a really interesting question. Wow,” a visibly tense Klopp said.           It wasn’t all bad news for Liverpool on Thursday, though.           Before the game, news broke that Reds forward Luis Díaz’s father, who was kidnapped by a Colombian guerrilla group last month, had been released.     Luis Díaz’s father released by Colombian guerrilla group         Luis Manuel Díaz and his wife, Cilenis Marulanda, were kidnapped by armed men from the National Liberation Army (ELN) on motorcycles at a gas station in Barrancas, the family’s hometown in northern Colombia, on October 28.           Marulanda was rescued later that same day, but a major police and military search operation had been ongoing in an attempt to find Díaz Sr.           On Thursday, shortly before kick-off in Toulouse, he was eventually handed over to representatives of the United Nations and the Catholic Church in Valledupar, Colombia.           “Lucho [Luis Díaz] is really happy. Thumbs up all the time. It looks good. Very, very good,” Klopp told TNT Sports before the match.           “Timing wise, it couldn’t have been better. If it’s today then great. That’s all I can say.”           When asked about his decision to start Díaz against Toulouse, Klopp said: “We asked him, he wants to [play] and he will.”    © 2023 Cable News Network. A Warner Bros.

world,Giannis Antetokounmpo erupts for 54 points but the Milwaukee Bucks lose to the Indiana Pacers,https://edition.cnn.com/2023/11/10/sport/giannis-antetokounmpo-bucks-pacers-nba-spt-intl/index.html," Giannis Antetokounmpo scored an NBA season-high 54 points in a losing cause as the Milwaukee Bucks went down 126-124 against the Indiana Pacers.           The Pacers let an 18-point lead melt away in Thursday’s game in Indianapolis and had to come back from 10 points down in the fourth quarter to record a third-straight win.           Tyrese Haliburton, who had 29 points, six rebounds and 10 assists, scored the go-ahead three pointer as the Pacers closed out the game, while Bennedict Mathurin added 26 points and 11 rebounds.           Two-time MVP Antetokounmpo, despite his hugely impressive points haul, committed two costly turnovers as the Bucks looked to regain the lead late in the game, the second when the ball was knocked away by Mathurin.           He finished one point off of his career-high tally, one night after he was ejected for “two unsportsmanlike technical fouls” in the Bucks’ 120-118 win over the Detroit Pistons.           “We had to deal with a player that was extraordinarily hot and on a roll and very, very difficult to deal with,” Pacers head coach Rick Carlisle told reporters postgame. “In the last three minutes … our guys did an amazing job at executing the double teams and the swarming.”           The Pacers got off to a fast start and led by 14 points by the end of the first quarter.           The Bucks, without Damian Lillard due to a calf injury, then rallied through the brilliance of Antetokounmpo, who scored 26 points in the first half and added another 20 in the third period alone.           But Milwaukee had to go without head coach Adrian Griffin for the latter stages of the game after he was ejected in the third for arguing a non-call on Antetokounmpo, later saying that he “thought Giannis was getting hit quite a bit.”           Griffin told reporters: “I voiced my opinion. Next time, I’ll do it in a little bit more [of a] delicate way. But it was a physical game and give them credit, they jumped on us early and they were able to pull out the win.”           The Bucks, now 5-3 on the season, will face the Orlando Magic on Saturday, the next instalment of what is turning into an eventful week for the ‘Greek Freak.’           “I felt strong, I felt like I could attack angles like I have been in the past,” Antetokounmpo told reporters after Thursday’s game.           “I’ve been feeling like this the last three games, that means I’m kind of getting my rhythm back. I’m happy about that … Hopefully, we can go to Orlando and get a win.”           The Pacers, meanwhile, are hitting the road to play the Philadelphia 76ers on Sunday.    © 2023 Cable News Network.

world,Caitlin Clark scores 44 points as No. 3 Iowa Hawkeyes beat No. 8 Virginia Tech 90-86,https://edition.cnn.com/2023/11/10/sport/caitlin-clark-44-points-iowa-hawkeyes-spt-intl/index.html,"       Behind a dominant performance from Caitlin Clark, the No. 3-ranked Iowa Hawkeyes took down the No. 8 Virginia Tech Hokies 90-86 and moved to 2-0 to start the season on Thursday.           Clark was responsible for almost half of her side’s scoring output, finishing with a monster stat line of 44 points, eight rebounds and six assists.           Although she was not at her most efficient, shooting 13-for-31 from the field, the 21-year-old still rained in five triples. Clark was naturally targeted by the opposing defense and was fouled 16 times on the night – converting 13 of 17 free throws – while the entire Virginia Tech team drew 18 fouls.     According to Iowa, it was the fifth time in Clark’s career she has registered over 40 points, five-plus assists and five-plus rebounds.           The Hawkeyes were quick out of the blocks and built a 13-4 lead early in the game, but the Hokies quickly responded. They went on a 14-2 run that was capped off by an incredible buzzer-beating, half-court shot by Georgia Amoore to give Virginia Tech an 18-15 lead.           The game was tight throughout the first half with the scoreline at 33-32 in Iowa’s favor heading into the break, with Clark contributing 18 points.           Iowa took control in the second half and did not relinquish its lead at any point, building a double-digit cushion in the third quarter.           Although Virginia Tech mounted a comeback and brought the game within two points inside the last minute of the game after a late Amoore triple, the Hokies were kept at bay by Iowa which held on for the narrow victory over its top-10 opponent.           “This was a great early season win,” said Iowa coach Lisa Bluder after the game. “Virginia Tech is a great team. Even though we shot the ball so poorly, we got to the boards and got to the free throw line. I’m really proud of this group tonight.”           Clark, the reigning National Player of the Year continues her red-hot start to her senior year, after racking up 28 points, seven rebounds and 10 assists against Fairleigh Dickinson University in a lopsided matchup that Hawkeyes won 102-46.           Iowa is undefeated through two games as it seeks to go one better this season, after being defeated in the NCAA national championship game by LSU earlier this year.    © 2023 Cable News Network.

world,CNN,https://edition.cnn.com/2023/11/01/world/cnn-heroes-top-10-2023/index.html,"       The ideas can be simple: converting a vehicle into a wash station for homeless veterans. Providing books for kids while they wait at the barbershop. Turning a passion for diving into a movement to save coral reefs.           These are just some of the incredible efforts performed by the people who have been selected as this year’s Top 10 CNN Heroes. Each will receive a $10,000 prize.           Their journey began with nominations sent in by CNN’s audience and now you can vote to help decide who will be named the 2023 CNN Hero of the Year and receive an additional $100,000 for their cause.           All of the honorees will receive a grant along with organizational and capacity-building support from The Elevate Prize Foundation. They will also participate in the foundation’s annual Make Good Famous Summit in Miami.           ﻿CNN has teamed up with GoFundMe to enable donations to this year’s honorees and learn more about their stories. Supporters can make online donations to the Top 10 CNN Heroes’ nonprofit organizations directly from CNNHeroes.com.           The CNN Hero of the Year will be revealed live during “CNN Heroes: An All-Star Tribute,” hosted by Anderson Cooper on Sunday, December 10, starting at 8 p.m. ET.           Read more about each of this year’s Top 10 CNN Heroes, below:           Growing up, Yasmine Arrington knew firsthand the challenges that came with having an incarcerated parent.           “My father has been in and out of jail and prison my entire life,” she said. “I began to do research, and I learned that there’s so many other people that are kind of my age experiencing what I’m experiencing.”           When she was 16, she created the nonprofit ScholarCHIPS – with CHIPS as an acronym for Children of Incarcerated Parents – to help young people like herself with scholarships, mentoring and a network of support.           The organization has since awarded more than $450,000 in scholarships and other aid and supported more than 80 scholars working toward their college degrees. New scholars join the program each year.           In many regions of Ghana, it can take hours to get to the nearest hospital. As a result, many people lose their lives to treatable illnesses. Osei Boateng experienced this personally when he lost his grandmother and aunt.           Feeling an urgent call to help, Boateng decided he would make it his life’s mission to bring health care to remote communities in Ghana.           “These people don’t have the luxury of time,” Boateng said.           Boateng started his nonprofit, OKB Hope Foundation, and in 2021, he converted a van into a mobile doctor’s office and started bringing health care directly to those in need.           A few times a week, the mobile clinic and medical team travel long distances to remote communities in Ghana and provide free routine medical care.           In 2008, a stroke and subsequent traumatic brain injury (TBI) nearly killed Stacey Buckner. Today, she says her miraculous road to recovery led her to the outreach work that has become her life’s mission.           Through her program, Off-Road Outreach, Buckner has helped more than 1,000 veterans in Fayetteville, North Carolina. Using her own off-road vehicle – a Jeep that has accommodations for water, heating, and cooking – Buckner provides mobile showers, laundry services, and meals to homeless veterans.           Since 2015, Buckner travels to hard-to-reach places each week to find and serve veterans in need. Without judgment, Buckner asks what she can do to help them.           “There should be no homeless vets, period,” Buckner said. “I am to a lot of them their only family.”           In 1996, Mike Goldberg left his job in Los Angeles to follow his passion for underwater diving. Goldberg and his family later settled in Islamorada, in the Florida Keys, and opened a dive shop, Key Dives.           As an avid diver, Goldberg developed a strong appreciation for the coral reefs and their essential role in the marine ecosystem. Today, he’s on a mission to help bring the area’s coral reefs back to life through his nonprofit, I.CARE.           Goldberg says the organization has transplanted more than 10,000 corals and educated more than 2,000 people. The I.CARE team monitors and maintains all of the transplanted coral, making sure it’s thriving.           “There’s so much work to do. We’re just getting started,” Goldberg said.           When Tescha Hawley received her breast cancer diagnosis at age 46, the lifesaving treatment she needed several times a month was at a hospital a three-hour drive away.           Hawley, a member of the Gros Ventre tribe, has two master’s degrees, yet the challenges she had to navigate to receive the care she needed were daunting. As a single mother, Hawley ultimately took leave without pay to complete her treatment.           “As American Indian people, we represent the highest (rates) of everything – diabetes, heart disease, cancer – and we receive the poorest health care,” Hawley said.           After her experience, Hawley founded the Day Eagle Hope Project in 2017, and her nonprofit has since expanded to address many other needs of Native Americans in her community.           In 2008, first grade teacher Alvin Irby stopped by a Bronx barbershop after school for a haircut. Before long, one of his students came in.           “He’s kind of looking bored,” Irby recalled. “I’m looking at this student (thinking), ‘He should be practicing his reading.’ But I didn’t have a book.”           That moment stayed with Irby, and five years later he started Barbershop Books. Since 2013, the nonprofit has brought more than 50,000 free children’s books to more than 200 barbershops in predominantly Black neighborhoods across the country.           Irby is working to change lower literacy rates by encouraging boys to read for fun, on their own.           “Our program is about getting kids to say three words: ‘I’m a reader,’” he said.           Kevin Pearce was at the height of his professional snowboarding career and bound for the Winter Olympics. During training, he struck his head on the edge of a halfpipe, resulting in a traumatic brain injury.           He had to relearn how to walk and talk. He eventually started yoga, and his family saw how it transformed him and gave him a sense of hope.           “I remember … coming out of a class with him and just seeing in his face this new expression, this new person,” his brother Adam Pearce said.           Wanting to bring hope and healing to others through yoga and meditation, Adam and Kevin co-founded the LoveYourBrain Foundation. The organization aims to create a safe space and supportive community where people with a TBI can heal together.           Estefanía Rebellón understands the fear and uncertainty felt by the more than 70 million migrant and forcibly displaced children around the world. She was a migrant child, too.           In 2018, she was so moved after volunteering in migrant camps in Tijuana, Mexico, that she put her acting career on hold.           “There were no schools set up to help these kids. They were walking around the camps barefoot,” she said.           Rebellón and her partner used their savings to buy tents and supplies and set up a makeshift school at the US-Mexico border. Then they transformed buses into mobile classrooms to reach more families.           Now, through her nonprofit, Yes We Can World Foundation, she provides education for children living in limbo in shelters at the border. Since 2019, Rebellón says the group has served more than 3,100 migrant children.           Every parent’s worst nightmare is losing their child. Shamayim Harris has lived through that nightmare – twice.           Her 2-year-old son was struck and killed in a hit-and-run in 2007 in Highland Park, a suburb of Detroit. Years later, her 23-year-old son was shot and killed while on a neighborhood watch.           “I needed to … change grief into glory, pain into power,” said Harris, who is known as Mama Shu.           In 2016, she created the Avalon Village, a nonprofit with the mission of creating a safe and nurturing space for the entire Highland Park community. Today, she and her organization own 45 lots of land across three blocks. The biggest project has been fully refurbishing an abandoned house into an after-school hub for children.           Dr. Kwane Stewart’s outreach on the streets started more than a decade ago. On a whim, the veterinarian stopped to examine the dog of a homeless man outside a 7-11 where he got his coffee.           Stewart treated the dog’s skin condition and the animal was transformed. But for Stewart, the man’s gratitude was a wakeup call: “Thank you for not ignoring me” were the words that Stewart says inspired his next chapter.           Stewart’s nonprofit, Project Street Vet, provides medical care to the pets of people experiencing homelessness.           “It doesn’t matter what your situation is … I see a pet in need, and I see a person who cares for them dearly who just needs some help,” Stewart said.    © 2023 Cable News Network.

world,"For hundreds of migrant children living in shelters at the border, this CNN Hero’s mobile classrooms offer education and stability",https://edition.cnn.com/2023/10/06/americas/california-mexico-border-school-migrants-cnnheroes/index.html,"       Estefanía Rebellón knows the trauma that stems from being forced to flee your home for safety. She understands the fear and uncertainty felt by the more than 70 million migrant and forcibly displaced children around the world.           She was a migrant child, too.           “My family’s case is the case of many refugees and migrants at the border. It was never a choice for our family to leave our home. We were forced out of it,” Rebellón, 32, said.            She was 10 when her family fled Cali, Colombia, because of death threats to her father, who had been forced into hiding. They settled in Miami, and with the support of teachers at school, Rebellón thrived. Now, through her nonprofit, Yes We Can World Foundation, she provides education for children living in limbo in shelters at the US-Mexico border.           Rebellón moved from Miami to Los Angeles when she was 21 to pursue an acting career. In 2018, she was so moved after volunteering in migrant camps in Tijuana that she put her career on hold.            “There were no schools set up to help these kids. They were walking around the camps barefoot,” she said. “I couldn’t forget about what I had just seen. And I was like, ‘I literally have to go back.’”           Rebellón and her partner, Kyle Schmidt, used about $1,000 of their savings to buy tents and supplies and set up a makeshift school at the border. They enlisted volunteer teachers to provide learning opportunities in the camps.           “We set up a school overnight and … told just a couple of kids,” Rebellón said. “It spread throughout the camp, and we had like over 50 kids surrounding us.”           In the months that followed, when those families living in the camps were moved to shelters, Rebellón and Schmidt wanted to continue offering educational services.           “I thought, “Why don’t we turn a bus into a mobile classroom, and we could take it to all the different shelters?” Rebellón said. “We literally just Googled and YouTubed how to convert a bus into a mobile classroom.”           Over the next year, Rebellón and Schmidt bought and gutted a bus, partnered with shelters, and drove the transformed bus over the border. Their goal: to provide bilingual educational programs to keep children in school.           “All the families that we work with and all the children that we work with on a daily basis are legally seeking asylum,” Rebellón said. “They’re going through all the processes that are being required of them.”           Rebellón’s organization hires professional teachers and tailors their curriculum to the specific needs of each student. The program has been accredited by the education secretary in Mexico and serves children ages 3 to 15 – a crucial period for education, Rebellón says.            Despite the challenges she faced as a migrant child, she says she was lucky to have teachers who advocated for her and guided her along the way.            Many migrant children do not have this support and often fall through the cracks and miss valuable school time. Many have been on the road for months, if not years, and have difficulty attending school because they are often in transit, without a permanent home. Safety, economic instability, poverty, lack of transportation, and perceived legal status are also factors.           “People don’t realize that this is such a long process for families,” Rebellón said. “It’s not just like you arrive at the border, you seek asylum, and your life is all rainbows. It takes decades and a lot of work and a lot of pain.”           Rebellón’s family navigated a decades-long legal process to obtain political asylum and later US citizenship. Her parents, both lawyers by trade, were forced to abandon their careers in Colombia and take on new jobs in the US to support their family of five. Her mother worked multiple jobs as a caregiver and her father worked nights at Walmart. He has worked there full time for nearly 20 years.              “Any time I get a chance, I share my immigration story with (the kids),” Rebellón said. “I always want the kids that come through our programs to realize that being a migrant is not something they need to be ashamed of.”           Today, Yes We Can Foundation educates 250-300 kids a day through its four school locations along the border and three mobile school buses. Since 2019, Rebellón says the group has served more than 3,100 migrant children from 10 countries.           Their program runs Monday through Friday from 9:00 am to 3:00 pm. School runs for the entire year, with no summer breaks. They also provide free uniforms, backpacks, and school supplies. Lessons focus on common core instruction in the subjects of language arts, math, and science as well as addressing practical and immediate needs like how to translate basic information including phone numbers and addresses.           “I want our efforts to be something permanent,” Rebellón said. “And that when it’s all said and done, we will be proud to look back and say that we were there when people needed us the most.”     Want to get involved?

politics,Ronen Zvulun/Reuters,https://edition.cnn.com/2023/11/09/politics/biden-diplomats-warn-middle-east-fury/index.html,"       The Biden administration has received stark warnings from American diplomats in the Arab world that its strong support for Israel’s destructive and deadly military campaign in Gaza “is losing us Arab publics for a generation,” according to a diplomatic cable obtained by CNN.           The cable underscores profound concern among American officials about the growing anger against the United States that erupted soon after Israel launched its operations against Hamas, following the militant group’s attacks in Israel on October 7 that left over 1,400 Israelis dead.           “We are losing badly on the messaging battlespace,” reads a Wednesday cable from the US Embassy in Oman, citing conversations with “a wide range of trusted and sober-minded contacts.”           The robust US support for Israel’s actions is being seen, the cable warns, “as material and moral culpability in what they consider to be possible war crimes.”           The cable from the embassy was written by the second-highest US official in Muscat and sent to, among others, the White House’s National Security Council, the CIA and the FBI. While it’s just one cable from a regional embassy, it provides a private snapshot of the alarm over the growing anti-US wave sweeping the Middle East.           Another cable obtained by CNN from the American embassy in Cairo relayed back to Washington, as part of a daily media summary, the commentary in a state-run Egyptian newspaper that “President Biden’s cruelty and disregard for Palestinians exceeded all previous US presidents.”           CNN has reached out to the State Department for comment.           President Joe Biden has been under growing pressure domestically and abroad over US support of Israel amid images of destruction in Gaza and the dire humanitarian crisis in the region. While the administration has resisted calls for a ceasefire, officials have worked to ramp up aid going into Gaza and pushed for humanitarian pauses to allow more assistance to flow into the enclave and to allow civilians to flee away from the fighting.           In recent days, US allies in the Arab world have made clear their deep anger at the humanitarian crisis in Gaza.           Last weekend, Secretary of State Antony Blinken attended a summit convened by the Jordanian foreign minister that was attended by the top diplomats from Egypt, Qatar, the United Arab Emirates, and Saudi Arabia, as well as the secretary general of the Palestine Liberation Organization.           At the summit, the Arab leaders called for an immediate ceasefire in Gaza while Blinken reiterated US opposition, arguing that it would give Hamas time to regroup and launch another attack on Israel.           The White House said Thursday that Israel had agreed to move forward with daily four-hour pauses of military operations in areas of Northern Gaza.           Blinken had an agreement in principle on the pauses after his meetings in Israel last week, even though Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu came out against the idea of humanitarian pauses on Friday, US officials told CNN. That was seen as the Israeli prime minister playing to his coalition, and the officials noted it was similar to when the Israeli government opposed humanitarian aid getting into Gaza before deciding to allow it.           Although Israel had already been instituting such pauses, American officials see this agreement as progress because the Israelis are using the language of “pauses,” which is something the US believes it can build on.           Still, within the administration, concerns have grown over US support for Israel.     CNN previously reported that some senior officials privately say there are aspects of Israel’s military operations they simply cannot stomach defending; calls for the US to back a ceasefire are growing among government employees; and others are distraught by the incessant images of Palestinian civilians being killed by Israeli airstrikes.           Biden has also been confronted by the frustration growing domestically.           The president was confronted by a protester calling for a ceasefire at a private fundraiser last week; pro-Palestinian protests have been a daily occurrence near the White House compound; and this week, one of the entrances near the West Wing was covered in bright-red handprints – meant to mimic blood – and words like “genocide Joe.”    © 2023 Cable News Network.

politics,Suspicious letters sent to election offices being investigated by federal law enforcement,https://edition.cnn.com/2023/11/09/politics/suspicious-letters-fentanyl-election-offices/index.html,"       Federal law enforcement officials are investigating reports of suspicious letters sent to public officials, a Justice Department spokesperson said Thursday.           “We are aware of the reports and the FBI and U.S. Postal Inspection Service are investigating this matter,” the department spokesperson said in response to an inquiry from CNN.           Public officials in California, Georgia, Nevada, Oregon, Texas and Washington state have reported receiving suspicious mail. Most of the letters appear to have targeted election offices.           Investigators are treating all the letters as connected for now, given the timing, a law enforcement official told CNN.           So far more than a dozen have been reported, the official said.           The FBI said it has “responded to multiple incidents involving suspicious letters sent to ballot counting centers in several states” but could not comment further on an ongoing matter. “The public can be assured that law enforcement will continue to keep the public’s safety as its top priority,” the agency added.           In a statement Thursday, Georgia Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger said Fulton County, Georgia – which includes large swaths of Atlanta – had been among the election offices in multiple states targeted with suspicious letters.           Officials in Georgia said the letter received by Fulton County was suspected to contain fentanyl.           “We’re working with our state and federal partners to determine if any additional Georgia officials are being targeted,” Raffensperger said. “Domestic terrorists will not trample on our right to free and fair elections.”           CNN previously reported that election offices across multiple counties in Washington state had received envelopes on Wednesday that contained powdery substances.           At a news conference Thursday, Raffensperger called on elected officials and political candidates to condemn the activity and invoked the death of his son to convey the seriousness of the matter.           “Some people like to call fentanyl a drug, but it’s actually poison,” he said. “It’ll kill you … very quickly and very easily. It’s very dangerous.”           “We lost our son five and half years ago due to fentanyl overdose. We know how deadly this stuff is,” Raffensperger said.           Fentanyl was found in an envelope received by election officials Wednesday in King County, Washington – home to Seattle – the county’s elections director Julie Wise told CNN.           Staffers opening the envelope Wednesday detected white powder and immediately isolated the letter, called law enforcement and evacuated the building, she said.           Wise said her staff did not read the contents of the letter, but she described the situation as eerily similar to one over the summer when another letter – this one saying that there should not be elections – was also later found to contain trace amounts of fentanyl. She said the US Postal Inspection Service investigated the earlier incident.           Wednesday’s letter arrived as officials were counting ballots following Tuesday’s local elections, and it prompted the evacuation of some 150 workers for about three hours, she said.           “It’s devastating” for the county’s election workers to be targeted in this fashion, Wise said. “They are human beings. They have families. They are here to do a job. They believe in democracy.”           But she said her team resumed work as soon as they could on Wednesday, undeterred by the incident.           “If anything, it’s fired us up even more,” Wise added. “It made us want to continue to do the important work of processing ballots. … We are not going to be broken down.”           In neighboring Oregon, an election office in Lane County – which is about 120 miles south of Portland – also received a suspicious piece of mail at their office on Wednesday, a county official told CNN.           In Texas, authorities were investigating a suspicious “letter containing an unknown substance” that was mailed to state Attorney General Ken Paxton’s office, the Texas Department of Public Safety spokesperson Ericka Miller told CNN. Miller said preliminary tests all “came back negative.”           The letter prompted the evacuation of two floors of a state office building in downtown Austin on Thursday.            While concerning, the timing of the arrival of the letters does raise questions among some law enforcement experts about the relative sophistication and seriousness of the threat.           “The near-simultaneous arrival of these letters seems to indicate they were also likely mailed at the same time, which can provide significant clues to investigators,” said CNN Security Correspondent Josh Campbell, a former FBI special agent who worked threat cases involving the US Postal Service. “US postal inspectors have sophisticated technology they can employ to track the sender of a particular letter down to the drop box it was placed in and the specific time of day it was mailed.”            The reports come against a backdrop of election officials facing threats and harassment, first ignited by false claims of a stolen election in 2020.           Voting rights activists and some state election chiefs have warned that the overheated political climate around voting has contributed to a wave of resignations and retirements by election officials around the country.           The US Justice Department has brought criminal charges against at least 14 people after creating a task force in 2021 to address threats against election workers, according to a recent department summary.           At Thursday’s news conference in Georgia, Fulton County Commissioner Robb Pitts said the letters show that there are “some crazy people out there who will go to any extreme to disrupt” US elections.           “It’s my personal belief that this is just probably a forerunner into what we can be prepared for in 2024.”     This story has been updated with additional information.

politics,Christie to visit Israel this weekend,https://edition.cnn.com/2023/11/09/politics/chris-christie-israel-visit/index.html,"       Former New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie will visit Israel on Sunday, which will make him the first Republican presidential candidate to visit the country since the October 7 Hamas attacks.           Christie, who has made US leadership on the world stage a focal point of his campaign, confirmed the trip, which was first reported by CNN, at a New Hampshire town hall Thursday.           The former New Jersey governor said he would meet with families of people kidnapped by Hamas, as well as Israel Defense Force soldiers and Israeli government officials.           He’s also scheduled to visit so-called Gaza envelope region in southern Israel, according to an itinerary of the trip shared with CNN.           Christie told reporters on Thursday that the Israeli government reached out last week to invite him to visit.           “They said they appreciated the things I was saying and the stance I was taking and if I was interested in coming over, they would be able to welcome me, and I made the decision to come,” he said.           CNN has reached out to the Israeli government for comment.           In what might have been a preview of his discussions this weekend with Israeli officials, Christie urged Israel from the debate stage Wednesday night in Miami to protect both its territorial integrity and the safety of its civilians and to ensure that “Hamas can never do this again.”           “The fact is that Israel and their intelligence community failed. They failed here, and they failed the people of the State of Israel,” he argued, saying the US needs to work closely with Israel to improve intelligence-gathering in the region.           He also encouraged Israeli leaders to “keep your eye on the ball,” in terms of working with “reasonable” Arab nations and isolating Iran in the Middle East.           Christie told CNN’s Anderson Cooper on Thursday he believes conversations about a two-state solution in the region “had to have stopped definitively” in the wake of the Hamas attacks, though he previously has expressed support for that ultimate outcome.           “I think there can’t be any discussion right now about a two-state solution until you dispose with Hamas’ ability to be able to bring that kind of terrorist attack again,” he said on “AC360.”           This will not be Christie’s first time in Israel – he visited the country in 2012 in his first foreign trip is governor.           Christie, who met with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky in Kyiv just months after launching his 2024 presidential bid, has made standing up to US adversaries abroad central to his vision for America and has distanced himself from rivals who are reluctant to provide aid to allies in wartime.           “This is the price we pay for being the leaders of the free world,” he said Wednesday, accusing China, Iran and North Korea of working to support Russia because “dictators work together.”           After he returns from Israel, Christie is expected to deliver a foreign policy address at the Hudson Institute on Wednesday and to further lay out his worldview.           President Joe Biden visited Israel last month in an extraordinary wartime trip to Tel Aviv, where he expressed his support for the country’s right to defend itself, as well as advocated easing civilian suffering in Gaza.           At the time, Christie said he thought it was “the right thing” for Biden to go to Israel and show “physical solidarity” with the US ally.           Since then, Israel has expanded its ground operations in Gaza, and growing political divides have erupted in the US and around the world over whether a ceasefire should be implemented.           The White House announced Thursday that Israel had agreed to move forward with daily four-hour pauses of military operations in areas of northern Gaza.           Christie previously told CNN he didn’t think a humanitarian pause in Israel’s ground invasion of Gaza would ultimately lead to American hostages being able to get out of the region.           “Look, I would think if we could get Americans out that would be a goal for us to reach, but I don’t think that would happen. I think what Hamas would want is not a pause. They would want a guarantee that Israel would not invade Gaza at all. And we can’t give them that guarantee because of the attack they perpetrated on October 7,” he said late last month.

politics,"Blinken denounces civilian toll in Gaza, says ‘far too many Palestinians have been killed’",https://edition.cnn.com/2023/11/10/politics/antony-blinken-israel-gaza/index.html,"       Secretary of State Antony Blinken on Friday gave one of his most direct condemnations of the civilian death toll in Gaza and said more needs to be done to “minimize harm to Palestinian civilians.”           Although Blinken commended Israel for its announcement of daily military pauses in areas of Northern Gaza and two evacuation corridors, he said that “there is more that can and should be done to minimize harm to Palestinian civilians.”           The top US diplomat has subtly shifted his messaging in the days since he departed the Middle East earlier this week to more directly voice condemnation of the civilian toll in Gaza and the US’ expectations for the Israeli government. However, he still has not condemned the Israeli government offensive and has continually voiced support for its right to defend itself.     Biden administration privately warned by American diplomats of growing fury against US in Arab world         “Far too many Palestinians have been killed. Far too many have suffered these past weeks,” Blinken said at a press availability in New Delhi at the end of a whirlwind trip that also included stops Israel, Jordan, the West Bank, Turkey, Iraq, Japan and South Korea.           “We want to do everything possible to prevent harm to them and to maximize the assistance that gets to them,” he said.           “To that end, we’ll be continuing to discuss with Israel the concrete steps to be taken to advance these objectives,” Blinken said, but declined to detail the specifics of those steps.           In Tokyo on Wednesday, Blinken described the US’ terms for a “durable and sustainable peace” in Gaza after the war, and on Friday he reiterated that “some progress” had been made in setting those “basic principles.”           “No forcible displacement of Palestinians from Gaza. No use of Gaza as a platform for launching terrorism or other attacks against Israel. No diminution of the territory in Gaza and a commitment to Palestinian land governance for Gaza and the West Bank and in a unified way,” Blinken said Friday. “These and some other ideas that we’ve put forward, and that others share, I think, can start to be the basis for what we need to do.”           “We have concrete plans, concrete things that we’re working on that that would” increase the amount of trucks with humanitarian aid reaching Gaza, Blinken said.           But “it’s always a process and moving from an understanding, moving from an agreement to the implementation is what we’re working on right now,” he added.           Blinken reiterated Friday that the US “will continue to focus relentlessly on getting our hostages home” and stopping the conflict from expanding.           Speaking in India Friday, Blinken said “some progress has been made” in the week since he met in Tel Aviv with Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and other Israeli officials, but “this is a process and it’s not always flipping the light switch.”           The White House said Thursday that Israel had agreed to move forward with daily four-hour pauses of military operations in areas of Northern Gaza. Blinken had an agreement in principle on the pauses after his meetings in Israel last Friday, US officials told CNN, though Netanyahu came out publicly against the idea just hours after the meeting. Those public comments were seen as messaging for his domestic audience and war cabinet, but one official noted that “every step of this is like pulling teeth.”           Blinken met Saturday with Arab counterparts in Jordan, and there was a clear divide between the US and regional leaders on the matter of a ceasefire.           On Wednesday at a meeting of the G7 Foreign Ministers, however, there was joint supported for humanitarian pauses -– not a ceasefire -– in Gaza “to facilitate urgently needed assistance, civilian movement, and the release of hostages.”           At a news conference following that meeting, Blinken said that “those calling for an immediate ceasefire have an obligation to explain how to address the unacceptable result that would likely bring.”    © 2023 Cable News Network.

politics,"Exclusive: What the woodworker saw: Trump documents trial may put resort workers on witness stand, sources say",https://edition.cnn.com/2023/11/09/politics/mar-a-lago-documents-case-witnesses/index.html,"       A plumber, a maid, a chauffeur and a woodworker are among Mar-a-Lago staffers and contract workers who federal prosecutors may call to testify against former President Donald Trump and his two co-defendants at their upcoming criminal trial in Florida, according to multiple people familiar with the investigation.           CNN has assembled a comprehensive picture of how prosecutors are structuring their case against Trump over his mishandling of classified documents found at Mar-a-Lago.           While some of the witnesses who may be called to testify hail from Trump’s inner circle, including his career in business, as a political candidate and from his time in the White House, other potential witnesses are the types of workers rarely noticed by Mar-a-Lago’s wealthy guests, according to the sources.           Other likely witnesses also include Trump Secret Service agents, former intelligence officials, as well as people who were in the room with Trump when he was captured on multiple audio recordings referencing a military document about potential plans to bomb Iran, according to the sources.           But the low-level workers who were the eyes and ears of Mar-a-Lago, if called to testify, could offer the public a new level of insight into the exclusive club and Trump’s approach to sensitive national security information since he left office. Some of them are still employed at Mar-a-Lago.           Currently, the trial is set to begin in Florida in May, well before the 2024 presidential election. But the federal judge presiding over the case, Aileen Cannon, is considering moving the trial until after the election, potentially burying details about Trump’s behavior until after voters go to the polls.           In all, prosecutors could use these witnesses to explain to a jury the free-wheeling environment presided over by Trump after he left the White House. The potential witnesses have already spoken — some multiple times — to federal investigators in detail about the level of security at the Mar-a-Lago resort, including how boxes of documents were kept there and whether they were visible or could have been accessed by visitors to the property.           A spokesman for the special counsel’s office declined to comment for this story. A spokesperson for Trump did not immediately respond to CNN’s request for comment.           Some of the witnesses told investigators what they saw at Mar-a-Lago caught their attention and seemed unusual, out-of-place or potentially suspicious.           A woodworker from south Florida, for instance, installed crown molding in Trump’s bedroom in February 2022 and noticed papers, according to three sources who spoke with CNN about what he told investigators. While the stack of papers he saw may have been classified, it wasn’t entirely clear to the woodworker what he had noticed strewn about the property.           “He thinks he saw things, doesn’t know what they were – he eventually told investigators he thought what he saw may be movie prop,” according to a source familiar with investigation.           A maid who cleaned Trump’s suite, a plumber who has worked at the property a few days a week for years, and several other maintenance workers are also among the potential witnesses, the sources said. Some of the workers may not ultimately be called as witnesses by prosecutors trying the case, and may not have even noticed boxes or papers around the property, according to sources familiar with the investigation.           Still, prosecutors working for special counsel Jack Smith made clear in their June indictment of Trump that the lax security once visitors were inside the Mar-a-Lago complex is an issue they intend to highlight to a jury.           “Mar-a-Lago was an active social club, which, between January 2021 and August 2022, hosted events for tens of thousands of members and guests,” including movie premieres, weddings and fundraisers, the indictment says.           A chauffeur was asked by investigators about powerful business-people, including foreigners, who had visited the club as VIP guests, according to one source. For instance, the chauffeur described ferrying around Australian billionaire Anthony Pratt, who could also be called as a witness.           Pratt visited Trump at Mar-a-Lago after Trump left office, and the former president shared with Pratt sensitive information regarding US nuclear submarines, two sources told CNN. That detail was previously reported by ABC News. That incident isn’t among the instances of mishandling national security information with which Trump is charged.           CNN has reached out to Pratt’s representative.           In their June indictment, prosecutors noted that Mar-a-Lago has 25 guest rooms, two ballrooms, a spa, a gift store, offices and a pool and exercise facilities. More than 150 workers – from temporary employees to full-time staff – milled about.           That setting is likely to come to life through witness testimony at the trial.           Prosecutors say the club wasn’t a place where classified documents were legally able to be stored, possessed, reviewed, displayed or even discussed after January 2021, making the presence of people without security clearances a risk to national security.           Trump is charged with mishandling 32 national security records – most of which are marked as classified – that he kept after the presidency, largely in boxes at Mar-a-Lago. He is also accused of working with his two codefendants – Walt Nauta, his body man, and Carlos De Oliveira, a valet turned-property manager at the club – to attempt to hide some of the boxes from the federal government and delete security footage of the boxes being moved.           In recent court proceedings, the prosecutors have identified publicly a few possible witnesses, including a receptionist at the club, the head of maintenance, and a personal aide to Trump.           Some of the people identified to CNN as possible witnesses are long-time Trump property employees who live in South Florida and had heard through word-of-mouth about Trump workers’ focus on attempting to delete the security footage.           Many of the former and current employees of the club still remain in regular contact, and relayed to one another news of the FBI search of the resort when it happened in August 2022. Before that, several of them had been approached by federal investigators for initial interviews. Some of them sat for additional interviews with prosecutors and appeared before a grand jury.           Jim Trusty, an attorney who stopped representing the former president in the documents case after Trump was indicted, told CNN’s Kaitlan Collins on “The Source” Thursday that a lot of “salt of the earth, good people, hard-working people down in the Mar-a-Lago scene,” were “aggressively” intimidated by the Justice Department and the FBI.           “It’s the kind of thing where, Kaitlan, you could drive by Mar-a-Lago, go to the beach and get a subpoena,” Trusty said.           The federal investigators diving deep into the Mar-a-Lago payroll angered the former president, who winters at the Florida property and regularly makes photo opportunities with guests at the club. When the maid who cleans his bedroom suite was asked to speak with investigators, for instance, Trump’s response was “ballistic,” one source told CNN.           One key witness, Yuscil Taveras, only recently resigned from working at the club as the director of IT as opening day for South Florida’s winter season approached, according to two sources who spoke to CNN. Taveras is identified in the indictment as “Trump Employee 4” and was publicly revealed to have received a favorable deal from prosecutors in exchange for his cooperation.           Yet Trump hadn’t known he had continued to be employed at the club following his split from a Trump-provided lawyer this summer, and the former president was unhappy to hear Taveras had still been working there, the sources said.           An attorney for Taveras declined to comment.  © 2023 Cable News Network. A Warner Bros. Discovery Company. All Rights Reserved.  CNN Sans ™ & © 2016 Cable News Network."
politics,Federal government begins initial communications to agencies on possible shutdown,https://edition.cnn.com/2023/11/10/politics/federal-government-communications-possible-shutdown/index.html,"       The White House Office of Management and Budget on Thursday began its initial communications to agencies on how to prepare for a possible government shutdown, a source familiar with the plans said, as lawmakers on Capitol Hill have yet to settle on a plan to avoid a shutdown by November 17.           The communications are part of the standard procedure laying out the steps toward bringing non-essential government functions to a halt.           “One week prior to the expiration of appropriations bills, regardless of whether the enactment of appropriations appears imminent, OMB will communicate with agency senior officials to remind agencies of their responsibilities to review and update orderly shutdown plans, and will share a draft communication template to notify employees of the status of appropriations,” a budget circular document from the Office of Management and Budget states.           Every department and agency has its own set of plans and procedures. Those plans include information on how many employees would get furloughed; which employees are essential and would work without pay (for example, air traffic controllers, Secret Service agents, US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention laboratory staff); how long it would take to wind down operations in the hours before a shutdown; and which activities would come to a halt.           The guidance comes as House Speaker Mike Johnson has yet to outline a path forward for avoiding a government shutdown. Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer on Thursday took the first procedural step to put a government funding bill on the floor that the  chamber could pass to avoid a shutdown. It amounts to a backstop measure that could be used if the GOP-controlled House isn’t able to pass a continuing resolution free of controversial measures that Democrats oppose. If the Senate were to pass it, the House would still have to approve it to avert a shutdown.           Speaking to reporters ahead of a trip to Illinois, President Joe Biden called on the House of Representatives to “get to work” as a shutdown draws closer.           “I wish the House would just get to work. I’m not being facetious … that’s not just a political statement. The idea that we’re playing games with a shutdown at this moment in history is bizarre,” Biden said.           White House principal deputy press secretary Olivia Dalton framed what could transpire next week as an “extreme Republican shutdown.”           “The clock is ticking.  We’re just eight days from a shutdown that would undermine our economy and national security, hurting families and businesses across our country in the process,” Dalton said. “An extreme Republican shutdown would force service members and law enforcement officers to work without pay, risk significant delays for travelers, undermine public health, and cut off funding for small businesses. That is unacceptable.”           This will be the second time in as many months that the government has started preparations for a possible shutdown. Departments and agencies began winding down operations in the final week of September as Congress barreled toward a shutdown, which was averted just hours before the deadline when then-House Speaker Kevin McCarthy put a stopgap measure on the floor – a move that ended up costing him the speakership.           The government shutdown for a record 35 days from December 2018 to January 2019 amid a congressional stalemate over funding for then-President Donald Trump’s border wall. The also government shut down for three days over a deadlock during the Trump administration in January 2018. And in 2013, then-President Barack Obama presided over a 16-day partial government shutdown caused by a dispute over the Affordable Care Act and other budget disagreements.    © 2023 Cable News Network.

politics,Georgia man charged with threatening Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene,https://edition.cnn.com/2023/11/09/politics/georgia-man-arrested-for-threatening-to-murder-congresswoman-marjorie-taylor-greene/index.html,"       A Georgia man has been charged with threatening to kill GOP Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene, her family, and her staff.           Sean Patrick Cirillo, 34, of Macon, Georgia, called Greene’s office on Wednesday and threatened to shoot and kill her, according to the representative’s office.           Greene’s office shared a recording of a threatening phone call with CNN.           “I’m going to murder her; I’m going to shoot her in the (expletive) head and kill her, OK,” the caller said. “Tell the FBI.”           “You’re going to die.  Your family is going to die,” the caller yelled.           Cirillo is charged with using communications devices to make threats, according to a spokesperson with the US Attorney’s Office for the Northern District of Georgia — a felony offense.           CNN has not yet been able to determine whether Cirillo has an attorney.           “I want to thank every single member of law enforcement who acted swiftly in response to this murderous threat. From Rome City Police, the Floyd County Sheriff’s Office, U.S. Capitol Police, the House Sergeant at Arms, and ultimately the FBI who made the arrest, every official acted quickly to put this man behind bars,” Greene told CNN in a written statement.           “I’m not the only victim with this threat of violence. My family is threatened. My staff is threatened. I even had to close my district office due to the potential of violence. It’s wrong and never should happen.”    © 2023 Cable News Network.

politics,Defense in DePape trial admits attack on Paul Pelosi but disputes official retaliation charges,https://edition.cnn.com/2023/11/09/politics/paul-pelosi-david-depape-attack-federal-trial/index.html,"       A defense attorney for David DePape admitted that her client attacked the husband of former House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, but argued during the first day of the federal trial against him that his motivation for the assault did not match the charges against him.           Jodi Linker, a defense attorney for DePape, claimed Thursday that his attack on Paul Pelosi was not in response to Nancy Pelosi’s actions in her official capacity as then-speaker of the House. Rather, she argued, it was motivated by his belief that Nancy Pelosi was part of a larger plot to “manipulate the country, to spread lies, and to steal votes from Donald Trump.”           DePape has pleaded not guilty to federal charges in connection with the attack on Paul Pelosi, including assault on the immediate family member of a federal official and the attempted kidnapping of a federal official. He faces a maximum of 30 years and 20 years, respectively, if found guilty on the charges.           “This case here is about the why — the why matters. This case is about whether David acted because of, on account of, Nancy Pelosi’s duties as a member of Congress. He didn’t,” Linker told the jury. “And he only struck Paul Pelosi in a quick moment of despair because the police arrived and his larger plan was thwarted.”           Linker said that DePape had other targets, including actor Tom Hanks, California Gov. Gavin Newsom and a University of Michigan professor.           Prosecutors argued Thursday that DePape “had a plan” when he broke into the Pelosi home. It was “a violent plan to kidnap Nancy Pelosi, to hold her hostage, to break her kneecaps, to teach her a lesson,” said Assistant US Attorney Laura Vartain Horn.           The first witnesses to take the stand included three police officers who responded to the break-in, a police lieutenant who interviewed DePape, and a crime scene investigator. Prosecutors also played video recordings showing the violent incident unfold and audio recordings of a police interview with DePape.           In the recording, DePape said he considered Nancy Pelosi to be “the leader of the pack” in a conspiracy he likened to Watergate.           Among those expected to testify in the trial are Paul Pelosi and the neurosurgeon who treated him for his injuries, court documents show. Nancy Pelosi is not expected to testify, according to court documents.           Jury selection for the trial concluded Monday, said Liz Noteware, director of courtroom operations for the US District Court for the Northern District of California. The trial is scheduled to run through next week.           DePape also pleaded not guilty to a litany of charges in state court, including for assault and attempted murder, among other charges, for breaking into the Pelosis’  home in October of last year and attacking Paul Pelosi with a hammer, according to court documents.           A date for the state trial will be set on November 29, according to the San Francisco District Attorney’s public information officer, Randy Quezada.     Video and audios files released at the order of a California court in January – against the protests of DePape’s lawyers – together with court documents, paint a violent picture of the attack, and the events leading up to it, as it happened inside the Pelosi home.           According to court documents, DePape allegedly woke Paul Pelosi shortly after 2 a.m., carrying a large hammer and several white zip ties, and demanded: “Where’s Nancy? Where’s Nancy?” He then threatened to tie up Paul Pelosi and prevented him from escaping via elevator, according to the documents.           In an audio recording of a San Francisco police officer’s interview of DePape following his arrest, DePape – embracing conspiracy theories about Democrats and the then-House speaker – admitted to attacking Paul Pelosi and described his plans to hold Nancy Pelosi hostage.           Paul Pelosi was able to place a 911 call when he went into his bathroom, where his cell phone was charging. Audio released from that call seemingly depicts Paul Pelosi subtly attempting to tell the dispatcher he was in danger while DePape was listening in.           Body-cam footage from officers who arrived at Pelosi’s home appears to show Paul Pelosi and DePape both with a hand on the hammer and DePape holding Paul Pelosi’s arm when the officers opened the door. When officers demand DePape drop the hammer, he declines, taking the hammer from Paul Pelosi and striking him in the head.           Following the attack, Paul Pelosi underwent surgery “to repair a skull fracture and serious injuries to his right arm and hands,” a spokesman for Nancy Pelosi said at the time. He has made appearances in public as he continues to recover, and Nancy Pelosi in August told CNN’s Jake Tapper he was “making great progress.”     CNN’s Jeffrey Kopp, Jeremy Herb, Jack Hannah, Veronica Miracle and Paul LeBlanc contributed to this report.

politics,"Joe Manchin won’t run for reelection, giving GOP an opening to flip West Virginia seat",https://edition.cnn.com/2023/11/09/politics/joe-manchin-wont-run-for-reelection/index.html,"       Sen. Joe Manchin of West Virginia will not run for reelection in 2024, the moderate Democrat announced on social media Thursday, a blow for his party’s chances to hold control of the Senate in next year’s election.           “After months of deliberation and long conversation with my family, I believe, in my heart of hearts, that I have accomplished what I set out to do for West Virginia,” Manchin said in a message posted on social media. “I have made one of the toughest decisions of my life, and decided that I will not be running for reelection to United States Senate.”           The Democratic Caucus controls the chamber with a narrow 51-49 margin, and Manchin’s decision not to run again in such a deeply red state puts Democrats in a tough spot, as they’ll be defending seats in other competitive states.           Montana Sen. Steve Daines, who chairs the National Republican Senatorial Committee, released a statement minutes after Manchin’s announcement, saying, “We like our odds in West Virginia.”           Manchin made clear in his announcement Thursday that he would not be leaving politics.           “But what I will be doing is traveling the country and speaking out, to see if there is an interest in creating a movement to mobilize the middle, and bring Americans together,” he said.           It’s unclear what specifically Manchin will do after leaving Capitol Hill. Earlier this year, he stoked speculation of a third-party presidential campaign, when he spoke at a No Labels forum at St. Anselm College in New Hampshire.           “I’ve never been in any race I’ve ever spoiled. I’ve been in races to win,” Manchin said at the time in July. “And if I get in a race, I’m going to win.”           Throughout his time in Washington, Manchin has found himself at odds with members of his own party, both in and out of the Capitol. Despite helping the president notch some key legislative wins in the first half of his presidency, the senator has also been an outspoken critic of Joe Biden, especially on issues of the environment, energy and the economy.     Biden paid tribute to the West Virginia Democrat in a statement Thursday, writing that the two “have worked together to get things done for hardworking families.”   “For more than forty years - as a state legislator, a Secretary of State, a Governor, and a Senator - Joe Manchin has dedicated himself to serving the people of his beloved West Virginia,” Biden wrote, pointing towards Manchin’s support of the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law, Inflation Reduction Act, as well his vote to confirm Ketanji Brown Jackson, the first Black woman to serve on the United States Supreme Court, among other things.   Manchin has both stymied and supported the president’s agenda during the first term of the Biden administration. The West Virginia Democrat has clashed with the administration on climate policy, while his opposition effectively blocked the confirmation of acting Labor Secretary Julie Su and Office of Management and Budget nominee Neera Tanden, who now serves as domestic policy adviser.   That said, Manchin’s about face on the president’s sweeping climate and health care law, the Inflation Reduction Act, allowed Biden to pass what’s largely seen as one of the hallmark laws of his presidency.         As a moderate, Manchin has worked to find compromise across the aisle with Republicans and rejected extremism, a message he referenced in his announcement.           “Every incentive in Washington is designed to make our politics extreme,” he said. “The growing divide between Democrats and Republicans is paralyzing Congress and worsening our nation’s problems. The majority of Americans are just plain worn out.”           Manchin, a former governor of West Virginia, was first elected to the Senate in 2010.

politics,Graeme Sloan/Sipa USA/AP,https://edition.cnn.com/2023/11/10/politics/joe-manchin-senate-west-virginia-democrats-jim-justice/index.html,"       Joe Manchin is going home to the place he belongs.           But the West Virginia senator’s Thursday announcement that he won’t seek reelection next year only refreshed a perennial question arising from his savvy instinct for accumulating power: What exactly is he up to?           Manchin’s departure will relieve one headache for those Democrats who were driven to distraction by his blockading and filleting of sweeping progressive legislation, including on issues like climate change.           But it will cause his party others. First, it could make Democrats’ already-tenuous hold on the Senate even shakier. Second, the announcement immediately stoked speculation that Manchin is mulling a third-party presidential bid.           Manchin’s decision to quit Washington comes as a formidable potential Republican challenger, West Virginia Gov. Jim Justice, leads in both primary and general-election polls. If the GOP captures the seat, it will complete the Mountain State’s total political transformation from one of the deepest-blue bastions in the union into one of the reddest and push a once-thriving species of conservative rural-state Democrats closer to extinction.           Manchin’s decision likely reflects a view that he won’t be able to secure reelection. And if Manchin can’t win in the MAGA stronghold of West Virginia, it’s impossible to believe any other Democrat can.           Liberals might disdain him, but Manchin’s victory by less than 20,000 votes in 2018 in a state where President Donald Trump won every county in a near-40-point romp two years later helped hand Democrats tiny recent Senate majorities.           With Manchin gone after the 2024 election, the Democrats’ current 51-49 Senate majority looks even more dicey. The party was already going to have to defend vulnerable seats in red states like Montana and Ohio to stay in power.           Manchin is also causing new conniptions inside a White House with which he’s long had testy relations. He accused White House staffers of saying “inexcusable” things when he helped collapse a huge climate and social policy bill in 2021.           In his announcement on Thursday, Manchin said he’d be “traveling the country and speaking out, to see if there is an interest in creating a movement to mobilize the middle, and bring Americans together.”           Manchin chooses his words carefully and knew full well this sentence would set off a cascade of speculation about a possible third-party presidential bid — especially since he’s associated himself with the No Labels group that is considering backing an independent run. As he has so often done in the Senate, Manchin appeared to be stoking ambiguity and intrigue designed to return him to the center of the spotlight in the way that replenishes his unique brand of political influence.          With President Joe Biden deeply unpopular and facing a cliffhanger reelection race, likely against a foe also craving a second term — Trump — a third-party ticket that peels away even a few votes in swing states could be disastrous for Democrats.           Manchin jolted Democrats in July when he traveled to New Hampshire to take part in the launch of a No Labels “common sense” platform on immigration, health care, gun control and the economy. He built anticipation for his visit by telling CNN’s Manu Raju at the time that “I’ve never ruled out anything or ruled in anything” and dodged questions over whether an independent presidential ticket could seriously hurt Biden in any race against Trump.           Even before Manchin’s Thursday announcement, the chances of a volatile election that could scramble the two-party calculus were rising. Robert F. Kennedy Jr. shelved a run for the Democratic nomination last month and announced his own independent run for president. Former Harvard professor Cornel West has already declared his independent bid. On Thursday, Jill Stein, who many Democrats blame for taking votes from Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton in 2016 and opening the door for Trump, said she’d seek the Green Party nomination.           Critics of third-party presidential campaigns often decry them as ego trips from candidates who have no chance of victory but who can siphon away sufficient votes in battlegrounds to have an outsize impact on who becomes president.           In a year when polls show that voters are deeply disdainful of both Trump and Biden, the temptation for third-party candidates is especially high.           “The idea that you could have a wild, wild West presidential campaign with numerous independents if they can solve the ballot access issues really could be problematic for Biden and Trump,” said Scott Jennings, a CNN political commentator. “Americans don’t want that rematch and they may be looking for a third, fourth, fifth door.”           Political analysts on the left worry that third-party candidates will take more votes from Biden than Trump, and they especially fret about a potential Manchin run.           “Joe Manchin is a Democrat, has been a Democrat all his life,” said David Axelrod, a former senior aide to President Barack Obama and CNN senior political commentator. “I think it would be very troublesome for the president if he were there,” Axelrod said, arguing that third-party candidates would lower the vote threshold Trump needs to win the White House.           There is little doubt that Manchin, a former state legislator and West Virginia governor, is frustrated with the vicious nature of polarized modern politics and the destruction of cross-party searches for consensus in the vanishing American political center. “Every incentive in Washington is designed to make our politics extreme,” he said Thursday. “The growing divide between Democrats and Republicans is paralyzing Congress and worsening our nation’s problems. The majority of Americans are just plain worn out.”           Manchin would like the attention that a spot on a third-party ticket would bring his attempt to save the nation from its poisoned politics. But after spending increasingly lonely years as a Democrat resisting a Republican tide in his home state, and after a proud career of statewide and national leadership, would Manchin really risk his political legacy on a final act that opened the Oval Office again to Trump?           Democratic Sen. Mark Warner of Virginia doesn’t think so. He told CNN’s Wolf Blitzer on Thursday: ”I cannot imagine a world in which Joe Manchin would do anything to help Donald Trump get elected.”           Manchin, who has often mythologized his hometown of Farmington, credits his relationships with West Virginians of all political stripes for a political approach that has frequently seen him break with Democrats to thwart progressive legislation, often in support of his state’s dwindling carbon industries. It would be hard to find a senator more protective of his constituents, more deeply aware of the tough economic and social forces like deindustrialization and opioid abuse that have ravaged Appalachia, or more devoted to the old-school lawmaker’s practice of unapologetically directing federal cash back to his state. This last attribute was inherited from his mentor Robert Byrd, whose seat Manchin filled in 2010 after the death of the veteran Democratic senator.           “He did have a good pulse on his constituency, not that he didn’t alienate some people on the left, which is a declining portion of the population here,” said John Kilwein, associate professor and chair of the department of political science at West Virginia University. “But he knew what he was doing, he got on the national shows … and presented himself as this commonsense, conservative Democrat and that played well at home.”           In the Senate, Manchin pursued an idea of civility and cooperation that long seemed an anachronism — even before Trump inspired a new wave of Republican senators who are keener on thwarting governance than legislating.           Ironically, given that he’s been so disruptive to elements of Biden’s domestic agenda, Manchin’s nostalgia for the old ways actually mirrors the president’s traditional view of how Washington should work. His influence hit a peak in the first two years of Biden’s term, when Democrats had a 50-50 Senate majority and Manchin had an effective veto on the president’s bills. His reluctance to support far-reaching progressive goals led to the scaling back of vital elements of Biden’s agenda, including on climate change. This and his refusal to contemplate abolishing the Senate filibuster to pass a massive voting-rights reform measure made him a pariah among left-wing Democrats.           As Manchin and a fellow moderate Arizona Sen. Kyrsten Sinema negotiated with the White House and progressive Democrats under massive pressure, crowds of reporters would trail Manchin through the Capitol hanging on his every word. Reports about Manchin’s meetings at his houseboat moored in Washington with fellow lawmakers only increased the intrigue. At one point, a bunch of kayaking protesters surrounded Manchin’s vessel, “Almost Heaven” — named for lyrics in John Denver’s classic song about Manchin’s beloved home state. Manchin leaned over the stern in his dress shirt and explained why he wasn’t signing up to the president’s budget reconciliation bill packed with social and climate spending.           In the end, however, Manchin backed the smaller Inflation Reduction Act which he had a hand in writing; and Biden’s bipartisan infrastructure law, which may have fallen short of original Democratic goals but which will shape the US economy and environment for decades to come and dominate the president’s legacy.         Manchin’s farewell to the Senate after the next election will reinforce a trend that has seen rural states turn almost exclusively to the Republican Party, which in the Trump era has become more blue-collar in nature. Democrats now seek their power bases in nations vast cities and suburbs.         West Virginia was once a Democratic bastion, however. In 1960, it handed John Kennedy a primary victory after a frenzied cross-state campaign that he credited with paving the way to the White House and ended fears that anti-Catholic bigotry could end his presidential hopes. The last Democrat to win the state in a presidential election was President Bill Clinton in his 1996 landslide. Democratic nominees now don’t even bother to visit the state, though it was the venue for some bitter late-primary campaign action between Hillary Clinton and Barack Obama in 2008.           Republicans are sure to secure West Virginia’s four electoral votes in 2024, and the state is almost certain to send a GOP senator to Washington in Manchin’s place. The state has “moved to the right, and this is just another manifestation of that,” Kilwein said. “It’s the end of an era.”    © 2023 Cable News Network. A Warner Bros. Discovery Company.

politics,Manchin’s retirement may end up being his biggest tease yet,https://edition.cnn.com/2023/11/10/politics/joe-manchin-senate-west-virginia-democrats-jim-justice/index.html,"       Joe Manchin is going home to the place he belongs.           But the West Virginia senator’s Thursday announcement that he won’t seek reelection next year only refreshed a perennial question arising from his savvy instinct for accumulating power: What exactly is he up to?           Manchin’s departure will relieve one headache for those Democrats who were driven to distraction by his blockading and filleting of sweeping progressive legislation, including on issues like climate change.           But it will cause his party others. First, it could make Democrats’ already-tenuous hold on the Senate even shakier. Second, the announcement immediately stoked speculation that Manchin is mulling a third-party presidential bid.           Manchin’s decision to quit Washington comes as a formidable potential Republican challenger, West Virginia Gov. Jim Justice, leads in both primary and general-election polls. If the GOP captures the seat, it will complete the Mountain State’s total political transformation from one of the deepest-blue bastions in the union into one of the reddest and push a once-thriving species of conservative rural-state Democrats closer to extinction.           Manchin’s decision likely reflects a view that he won’t be able to secure reelection. And if Manchin can’t win in the MAGA stronghold of West Virginia, it’s impossible to believe any other Democrat can.           Liberals might disdain him, but Manchin’s victory by less than 20,000 votes in 2018 in a state where President Donald Trump won every county in a near-40-point romp two years later helped hand Democrats tiny recent Senate majorities.           With Manchin gone after the 2024 election, the Democrats’ current 51-49 Senate majority looks even more dicey. The party was already going to have to defend vulnerable seats in red states like Montana and Ohio to stay in power.           Manchin is also causing new conniptions inside a White House with which he’s long had testy relations. He accused White House staffers of saying “inexcusable” things when he helped collapse a huge climate and social policy bill in 2021.

politics,Republicans flail on abortion as Democrats embrace a top 2024 issue,https://edition.cnn.com/2023/11/09/politics/republicans-abortion-2024/index.html,"       Republicans admit abortion rights are a huge challenge for them in 2024 but judging by their presidential debate Wednesday, they’re nowhere near defusing an issue that has cost them votes ever since Roe v. Wade was overturned last year.           A day after Democrats leveraged reproductive rights to rack up big election wins in Virginia, Ohio and Kentucky, Republican hopefuls attempted an impossible balancing act. They sought to satisfy anti-abortion rights base voters for whom the movement to overturn Roe was an article of faith. But they also tried to avoid alienating suburban moderates and female voters critical to deciding the destiny of the White House and Congress next year.           The five candidates on stage for NBC’s debate in Miami came up with at least five different positions about the extent to which abortion should be allowed and over whether the federal government or the states should adjudicate the issue. The mess of approaches underscored how Republicans – who for years used the stark clarity of the anti-abortion drive to galvanize their voters – now lack a single compelling position to combat political messaging from Democrats and pro-abortion rights groups.           Former South Carolina Gov. Nikki Haley, who has warned long before Wednesday that the GOP is failing to communicate on abortion outside their base, said that although she is strongly against the procedure, Republicans have to recognize there is no majority in the Senate for passing a national ban. “No Republican president can ban abortions,” Haley said, repeating a consistent position perhaps designed to avoid angering women and independent voters in a broader general electorate. “As much as I am pro-life, I don’t judge anyone for being pro-choice,” Haley said. She called for a search for “consensus” on the issue though didn’t say how it might be reached.           Haley’s main rival to be the alternative to former President Donald Trump in the GOP race, Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis, signed his state’s six-week abortion ban earlier this year. If he made it to the general election, the move could drive away moderate voters. Apparently seeking to ease such vulnerabilities, he recognized that some states might take a different position than Florida. He also suggested conservatives start winning ballot initiatives, which is easier said than done. “You have got to do a better job on these referenda. I think of all the stuff that’s happened on the pro-life cause, they’ve been caught flat-footed on these referenda and they’ve been losing the referenda.”           South Carolina Sen. Tim Scott said that as president he would “have” a 15-week national abortion ban, though gave no details on how he’d get it passed in Congress. Biotech executive Vivek Ramaswamy, meanwhile, said it was time for a “new generation” to lead the country to a better place on abortion, though aside from advocating more success in ballot measures, he failed to say how he would get there. Former New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie argued that since the Supreme Court’s Dobbs decision last year was rooted in returning the issue to the states, that’s where it should be decided. “I trust the people of this country, state-by-state, to make the call for themselves,” Christie said.           The Republican candidate who could be most exposed by the abortion issue was not on stage. Trump, the GOP’s runaway front-runner, is boycotting the debates since he sees no political advantage in sparring with his distant challengers. Trump steered clear of the issue, beyond generally touting the conservative Supreme Court majority, at his Florida rally Wednesday evening.           While Trump’s abortion position is less hardline than some of his GOP rivals, he’s insulated politically in the primary since he built that Supreme Court majority that accomplished a generational goal of anti-abortion campaigners.           But the former president’s heavy-handed efforts to parse the abortion issue recently show he understands the danger abortion politics could pose in a general election.           Trump is simultaneously seeking to claim credit for the court throwing out Roe v. Wade after half a century and to avoid any backlash from that judicial earthquake. He said in an interview with NBC’s “Meet the Press” in September, “I did something that nobody thought was possible and Roe v. Wade was terminated and put back to the states.”           But Trump repeatedly prevaricated when asked whether he would sign any law that, for instance, banned abortion after 15 weeks – a similar cut-off to one with exceptions backed by Virginia Gov. Glenn Youngkin in a proposal with exceptions that was effectively rejected when Democrats held control of the state Senate and flipped the House on Tuesday.           The ex-president’s answers degenerated into incoherence when he was put on the spot. “What’s going to happen is you’re going to come up with a number of weeks or months. You’re going to come up with a number that’s going to make people happy,” he told NBC. Betraying his lack of a plan on the issue and an absence of deep thinking, Trump added: “Something will happen with the number of weeks, the amount of time, after which you can’t do it. … You will win on this issue when you come up with the right number of weeks.”           Amazingly, after such waffling, Trump complained: “I think the Republicans speak very inarticulately about this subject.”           As well as their wins in Virginia, Democrats and abortion rights campaigners were celebrating after voters in Ohio, now a reliable red state in presidential elections, approved an amendment to the state constitution enshrining the right to an abortion. And in deeply conservative Kentucky, Democratic Gov. Andy Beshear secured a second term after a campaign in which he slammed his opponent, Republican Daniel Cameron, for opposing exceptions to the state’s abortion ban.           Top Democratic leaders rushed to capitalize on Tuesday’s victories and create momentum for Biden, after a rough set of polls, by putting abortion rights at the center of the 2024 campaign.           Vice President Kamala Harris initiated a rare media opportunity with reporters outside the West Wing. Abortion seems likely to be one of her signature issues on the campaign trail. “ Voters said, ‘Look, the government should not be telling a woman what to do with her body,’” Harris said. “I think voters have been clear, regardless of whether they’re in a so-called red or blue state, that one does not have to abandon their faith or deeply held beliefs to agree that government should not be telling a woman what to do with her body.”           Biden’s campaign issued a statement, slamming Trump for his part in overturning Roe v. Wade and associating him with abortion bans adopted by deeply conservative states.           “Voters deserve to hear Donald Trump’s own words,” said Biden campaign spokesperson Ammar Moussa. “As he’s said many times, no one did more to pave the way for abortion bans than Trump, and he was proud and honored to do it. Republicans across the country are tied to Trump’s losing MAGA agenda of ripping away Americans’ fundamental freedoms and voters will hold Donald Trump and his MAGA buddies accountable next November.”           Democrats countrywide are already targeting GOP candidates lower down the ballot. The Montana Democratic Party, for instance, criticized Tim Sheehy, a Republican running to unseat Democratic Sen. Jon Tester, and GOP Rep. Matt Rosendale, who is also considering a bid, warning that their anti-abortion rights positions will “haunt them on the campaign trail.” The campaign of Ohio Democratic Sen. Sherrod Brown – another vulnerable senator next year – released a video highlighting his GOP opponents’ anti-abortion rights positions.           As they digested a second straight year of downbeat election results, some top Republicans admitted Wednesday that they need a more nuanced take on abortion. With Democrats seeking to add abortion measures to the ballot in swing states next year, the GOP is starting to look for ways to combat Democratic victories – or at least to try to find a way to win on such referenda. “You have to accept that we have some real public opinion and persuasion work to do,” Ohio GOP Sen. JD Vance told CNN. “If you can’t admit that, I don’t think you’re being serious about the issue.” Unlike many Republicans, who want to avoid taking hard positions on an issue the Supreme Court allowed them to leave to the states, Vance called for a national GOP position. He is advocating a new law imposing a 15-week ban on abortion with exceptions.           South Dakota Sen. John Thune, a member of the GOP leadership, meanwhile predicted Democrats will make abortion central to 2024 and that the GOP needs to be ready. “For sure it’s going to be an issue. Democrats are going to insist that it is. And I think Republican candidates are going to have to have an answer and explanation for why they believe what they do,” Thune said.           Utah Sen. Mitt Romney told CNN’s Manu Raju that Republican candidates should focus more closely on issues like the cost of living. “When we’re talking about some social issues, they can become highly divisive and we end up not doing as well as we could have,” said the senator, who’s not seeking reelection.           Polls have repeatedly shown that candidates are looking closely at candidates and their positions on abortion. In a CNN/SSRS poll conducted in August, for instance, 64% of US adults said they disapproved of last year’s Supreme Court decision that women don’t have a constitutional right to abortion. Just 16% of people polled didn’t see abortion as a major issue, a record low in CNN polling dating back to 1996.           Those eagle-eyed voters are not seeing much yet from Republicans that suggests they will force Democrats to cede the advantage on the issue next year.    © 2023 Cable News Network. A Warner Bros.

politics,5 takeaways from new polls that reveal Biden’s challenges and Trump’s potential victory path,https://edition.cnn.com/2023/11/08/politics/trump-biden-election-cnn-poll-takeaways/index.html,"       A big night for Democrats Tuesday in state races only highlighted the struggles Joe Biden faces in 2024 following polls suggesting he’s far less popular than his party.           The new surveys are again casting doubt on the rationale of a second term for Biden, who turns 81 later this month and is losing support from critical younger and minority voters even as Democrats running in 2023 elections hit on issues that resonate.           The topline of a new CNN/SSRS survey of registered voters published Tuesday shows ex-President Donald Trump leading Biden 49% to 45%, which is bad enough for the president. But a deep dive into the data reveals alarming challenges for Biden and bolsters the impression that despite the mayhem and mismanagement of Trump’s first term, the GOP front-runner has a strong chance at a second.           The new poll reveals deep public discontent with Biden’s job performance at a time when his economic optimism is failing to connect with a disgruntled nation weary of high prices. The survey exposes cracks in Biden’s multiethnic Democratic coalition and a lack of confidence in his leadership in a war-torn world. Most damagingly, the data show that just a quarter of Americans believe he has the stamina and sharpness to serve as president.     CNN Poll: Trump narrowly leads Biden in hypothetical rematch         This survey follows New York Times/Siena College polling over the weekend that show significant leads for Trump in most of the swing states likely to decide the 2024 election. That triggered another round of agonizing among Democrats over whether Biden should have passed on a run for a second term – even if no realistic challenger for the nomination has emerged in a new generation of the party.           Biden’s poor polling contrasts with a strong election night for Democrats on Tuesday when voters in Ohio enshrined abortion rights in the state constitution and Democratic Gov. Andy Beshear won a second term in Kentucky, a deep red state, CNN projected. Democrats picked up the Virginia state House to take full control of the commonwealth’s legislature – a blow to GOP Gov. Glenn Youngkin.           This could mean polls are underplaying Democrats’ resilience under Biden, as they did in last year’s midterms when a Republican red wave was averted. “Voters vote. Polls don’t. Now let’s go win next year,” Biden posted on X seeking credit for Tuesday’s results and to inject momentum into his 2024 campaign.           There is another interpretation of Tuesday’s results, however. Biden appears to be less popular than some of his party’s policies and some of its other candidates, raising the possibility that someone else would be better at keeping the Democratic coalition together next year.           Four years ago, Biden presented himself as a calm, serious, sincere leader who could bring back a sense of normality after a murderous pandemic ruined the economy and Trump threatened to tear the nation apart. But that restoration has been elusive as a resilient economy still hasn’t given many Americans the relief they hoped for. A poisoned political climate Biden diagnosed as reeling with “racism, nativism, fear, and demonization” in his inaugural address seems like it actually may have worsened nearly three years later.           But the biggest difference between now and then is that Biden is not being judged compared to Trump and the chaos he wreaked. Biden is being evaluated by voters on his political record, against his promises and for his personal demeanor. And a year out from the next election, the country is not getting what it wants.           The standard defense of Biden’s reelection hopes among top Democrats, who CNN reported Tuesday are seeing a silver lining in the polls, is that voters will again perceive a glaring comparison between Biden’s battle to reclaim the soul of America and his extremist anti-democratic predecessor’s vow to claim a second term he’d devote to “retribution” against his enemies. Assuming Trump is the Republican nominee, there may be some truth to the argument. Trump, despite his rants on social media, hasn’t been a cacophonous presence in the lives of most Americans’ daily lives for years. The country did not get to see, for example, the display of petulance, fury and bile that he served up from the witness stand of his off-camera civil fraud trial in New York on Monday. Once he’s back in the public eye every day, the behavior that alienated vast swathes of the critical suburbs in swing states could begin to again diminish Trump’s poll numbers.     Biden allies look for silver linings in panic sparked by lackluster polls         Biden was also far more successful than most pundits expected in framing last year’s midterm elections as a referendum on what he calls the “MAGA-extremism” of Trump’s GOP – a charge that could become even more resonant if the ex-president tops the ticket. And the political impact of a potential future president who faces four criminal trials – several of which are scheduled to take place in election year – cannot be predicted. After all, Americans have never had to consider the possibility that one of the two major parties could pick someone who could be a convicted felon as its nominee for commander in chief. A year is a long time, and there’s also the possibility that Americans’ perceptions of the economy could improve in the next year and boost Biden’s standing.           But Tuesday’s CNN poll in particular carries some alarming warnings at this point for the president’s reelection hopes, which means the 2024 race is likely to be far more layered than the simple one-on-one match-up Biden’s camp envisages. Here are five dynamics that could spell challenges for Biden.           Biden’s age and capacity to do the job of president is dominating voter concerns at the same time as he is failing to forge bonds with younger voters who are critical to Democratic turnout models. Biden, with his subdued, halting rhetoric hardly exudes gusto. Age, personal tragedy, and the burdens of office mean he’s unrecognizable from the beaming, back-slapping senator of 15 years ago. While the president has launched daring foreign policy trips into war zones in Ukraine and Israel, the public isn’t getting the impression of vigor, even though it’s arguable that Biden is in trimmer physical shape than Trump.           The ex-president, who is himself 77, doesn’t suffer from the same perceptions. His egotistical, manic energy seems to have convinced voters that he’s physically fit for office, even if his stream of consciousness public statements are often incoherent upon deeper examination. The CNN poll finds that 25% of voters believe Biden has the stamina and sharpness to serve effectively, while 53% say Trump does. And the worries about Biden are bipartisan. Only about half of Democrats believe that Biden has the requisite stamina and sharpness.           If age is really a barrier for many voters, there is little the president can do about it. He’ll turn 82 after the election and would be 86 before the end of a possible second term. The CNN poll encapsulates this potential dilemma for voters. Will they have to consider picking a president who only a quarter of them think is up to the job just to avoid the uproar, democratic erosion and anger a new Trump term would bring?           The president’s strategy of highlighting strong job and economic growth numbers and his historic infrastructure package – sold under the umbrella of “Bidenomics” – is a currently a failure. A sense of malaise, not reflected in many economic indicators, is nevertheless conjuring voter nostalgia for the Trump economy. In The New York Times survey of battleground states, Trump led Biden by 10 points in Nevada, by 6 in Georgia, by 5 in Arizona and by 5 in Michigan. Across states surveyed, only 19% viewed the economy as excellent or good.           While Democrats hope that high interest rates will abate next year and ease the pressure on families struggling with car loans, mortgages and credit card debt, Biden is already on the edge of a precipice on the economy. And given his national approval rating in the CNN poll of only 39%, any economic downturn next year would be disastrous for him. This feeling that he’s lost his grip on the economy comes despite Biden’s drive to reform it on behalf of working Americans, his plan to revive manufacturing, to create an American semi-conductor chip industry, a push to lower prescription drug prices and massive investments in green energy. While inflation has fallen sharply since post-pandemic highs, Americans still complain of high prices for essentials like eggs and milk, creating a disconnect with Biden’s upbeat assessments of the economy.           Former Democratic Rep. Tim Ryan told CNN’s Wolf Blitzer that the White House’s economic strategy is not merely falling short, it’s actively hurting Biden. “I think the president’s messaging on the economy, of telling people that they are doing better than they are doing, is not going to work,” the former Ohio lawmaker, who has said that Biden should not run for another term, said Tuesday. “I wish that would stop. … I hear what people are saying. Bacon is more expensive, gas is more expensive, groceries are more expensive, rent is more expensive. We need to focus on their concerns.”           At a time when the world may look like it’s in chaos – during Israel’s war against Hamas, Russia’s onslaught in Ukraine and China’s challenge to US global power – Biden’s self-defined foreign policy expertise is counting for little. Voters see Trump as a stronger leader, suggesting that bluster and threats are more convincing than Biden’s nuanced approach. The CNN poll showed that only 36% view the president as an effective global leader while 48% think the same of Trump, despite a tumultuous term in which he trashed US allies and cozied up to tyrants.           Furthermore, Biden’s positions abroad may be hurting him at home. Polls show that the president is shedding support among younger voters – a cohort that has been critical of his staunch support for Israel’s assault on Gaza, which has killed thousands of civilians in response to last month’s Hamas terror attacks in Israel. The CNN survey found that 47% of those voters back Biden while 48% back Trump. In 2020, Biden won that demographic by 21 points nationally, according to exit polls, although those who actually turn out to vote are not the same as the registered voters.           Assurances from Democratic leaders that the tide will inevitably turn in Biden’s favor because of the advantages of incumbency also ignore the fact that his approval ratings are running behind predecessors who won a second term. The analogy is often made to Bill Clinton and Barack Obama’s reelection bids that defied early political troubles.           But the 42nd president was at 52% in November 1995 and the 44th was at 46% in 2011. Biden is languishing at 39%, two points below Trump’s mark a year before he lost the 2020 election and ahead of only one-term Jimmy Carter. Politics has become even more polarized in the years since Obama and Clinton won second terms, so Biden’s approval ratings are perhaps bound to be lower. But the comparison reflects the political test Biden faces, raising the question of whether he has the campaigning skill and energy to rebound.           The most ominous takeaway from the CNN poll is that conditions are potentially falling into place that could plausibly lead to the return to power of a twice-impeached former president with autocratic tendencies. The public is deeply unhappy – and would seemingly prefer any other matchup.           CNN found that 72% of all Americans say things in the country today are going badly and a broad majority have thought so all the months that Biden has been in office. Negative perceptions of the economy are likely to further worsen the public mood. And Democratic voters seem far less engaged and enthusiastic than Republicans. The CNN survey, for example, finds that 71% of Republican and Republican-leaning voters are extremely motivated to vote in next year’s presidential election versus 61% of Democrats and Democratic-leaning voters. And Biden’s struggles are depriving Trump’s GOP primary rivals of the argument that he’s so compromised that he couldn’t beat the president in 2024.           Moreover, Biden is running at far worse levels than he was among vital sectors of the Democratic coalition than he was in 2020. He leads Trump among Black voters 73% to 23% but won this cohort by 75 points in 2020. Latino voters favor Biden over Trump by only four points compared to 33 points in the 2020 election. The former president is winning independent voters by four points in the CNN poll but lost them to Biden by 13 points in 2020. Many political analysts consider that such numbers are unlikely to be repeated in a general election when more established patterns might reassert themselves. But the big risk for the president is if disillusioned young and minority voters don’t show up at the polls and threaten the tiny margins by which he won key swing states in 2020.           Despair among voters with economic conditions, a general feeling of national despondency, and sense that events are spiraling out of control abroad always spell trouble for incumbents. And history suggests that a combination of such factors – with voter cynicism and a loss of hope – provide the conditions in which demagogues offering strongman leadership can prosper.           That’s what Trump is counting on. And it’s what Biden needs to fix.    © 2023 Cable News Network. A Warner Bros. Discovery Company. All Rights Reserved.  CNN Sans ™ & © 2016 Cable News Network."
politics,This geographic shift may decide Tuesday’s elections,https://edition.cnn.com/2023/11/07/politics/fault-lines-suburbs-elections-2023/index.html,"       The biggest question in Tuesday’s elections may be whether Democrats can maintain their advantages in the nation’s biggest population centers – despite all the headwinds buffeting the party.           Geographic polarization has been one of the most powerful trends in American politics for roughly the past two decades, with Democrats gaining ground in the most populous metropolitan areas almost everywhere, and Republicans growing stronger in the smaller places beyond them. That trend notably accelerated after Donald Trump emerged as the GOP’s dominant figure in 2016 and has ratcheted up since the Supreme Court rescinded the constitutional right to abortion last year.           The GOP’s dominance of exurban, small-town and rural areas helped Trump win the White House in 2016 and has allowed the party to solidify its grip up and down the ballot on interior states with large nonurban populations. But Republicans’ retreat from the well-educated inner suburbs around major cities has been the principal reason for their disappointing results in the 2018, 2020 and 2022 elections, as well as the anti-abortion movement’s defeat in a series of ballot initiatives since the 2022 Supreme Court decision.     Visit CNN’s Election Center to follow key races         By traditional measures, the political environment for Tuesday’s election again looks favorable for Republicans, with most voters expressing dissatisfaction about both the economy and President Joe Biden’s job performance. But all of those conditions were present in the 2022 midterms, when Republicans underperformed anyway, mostly because of continued resistance in the major population centers – especially those well-educated inner suburbs where most voters oppose new restrictions on abortion.           The largest urban and suburban areas will likely determine whether Democrats can defy political gravity once again this year in Tuesday’s key elections, from Kentucky and Ohio to Virginia and Pennsylvania. If Democrats run well, it will reinforce the message from the 2022 midterms that they can hold a critical swathe of voters who feel the party has not delivered for their interests by portraying Republicans as a threat to their rights and values.           That dynamic may be most clearly on display in the expensive, high-stakes struggle for control of the Virginia legislature. Heading into Tuesday’s vote, Democrats hold a narrow majority in the state Senate and Republicans hold a slim edge in the state House of Delegates.           As in many competitive states during the 2022 election, Republicans, by most conventional political measures, are well positioned in Virginia. Even though Biden carried the commonwealth by 10 percentage points in 2020, polling now shows more voters disapprove than approve of his performance; conversely, Republican Gov. Glenn Youngkin, who has made himself the face of the GOP’s legislative campaign, consistently draws majority approval from state voters. To support the GOP ticket, Youngkin has also raised huge sums of money – much of it from national Republican donors hoping that a strong result Tuesday might entice him into a late entry into the GOP presidential race. And in a recent statewide poll by The Washington Post and the Schar School of Policy and Government at George Mason University, Virginia voters gave Republicans a double-digit advantage over Democrats when asked which party they trusted to handle both the economy and crime, two issues central to families’ day-to-day concerns.           “In normal circumstances, with an incumbent Democrat [president] under water, as Biden is, and the economy playing so strongly in favor of Republicans, you would expect a Democratic wipe-out,” said Mark Rozell, dean of the Schar School. “But that’s just not happening.”           Instead, the Post/Schar survey showed Democrats slightly leading when voters were asked which party they intended to support in the Virginia legislative contests.           Translating that broad sentiment into individual state House and Senate race results is an imperfect process. And because the margins in each chamber are so narrow, most analysts agree that both chambers are still within reach of either party.           But generally, observers following the contests say they will be surprised if Republicans win control of both chambers – and maybe less startled if Democrats flip the state House while holding the Senate to achieve control of their own. “It doesn’t really feel like 2021,” when Youngkin stunned Democrats by surging in the final weeks to capture the governorship, said Kyle Kondik, managing editor for Sabato’s Crystal Ball, the political newsletter published by the University of Virginia’s Center for Politics. “At the very least a Republican sweep would be a surprise. And a Democratic sweep would be less surprising.”   These candidates in Virginia could shape how both parties talk about abortion in 2024         Both parties agree the Democratic emphasis on protecting legal abortion is the principal reason the party remains in such a competitive position, despite all the other GOP advantages. In the Post/Schar poll, Democrats led Republicans by nearly 20 points when Virginia voters were asked which party they trusted to handle abortion; the share of female voters who said abortion was an important issue in their choice stood at 70%, way up from just under half in polling around the 2019 legislative elections. Warnings that Republicans will restrict abortion rights dominate Democratic advertising in most of the key races.  “If we win, we win because of it,” Celinda Lake, a Democratic pollster working on the Virginia races, said of abortion. “And if we turn out our base, we turn out our base because of it.”           The Democratic emphasis on preserving abortion rights isn’t unusual: The party did the same in virtually every competitive race in 2022. More unusual is how much Virginia Republicans have emphasized the issue too. Youngkin has made clear that if provided control of the legislature, Republicans will ban abortion at 15 weeks, with exceptions for rape, incest and the life of the mother. The governor’s political advisers argue that voters will see such restrictions as a “consensus” solution to a polarizing issue, and the latest Post/Schar poll, like earlier surveys, found the state split about evenly over a 15-week ban. “I really feel that this is a moment for us to come together around reasonable limits,” Youngkin argued on ABC News this past weekend. “I think that this is a reasonable place for us to land.”           But Democrats believe the more telling measure is that only about one-fourth of Virginia voters say in polls they want the state’s abortion laws made more restrictive than the current standard, which permits the procedure through 26 weeks of pregnancy. By emphasizing their plan to prohibit abortions after 15 weeks, Rozell and others believe, Republicans have raised the salience of the issue that most favors Democrats. Heather Williams, the interim president of the Democratic Legislative Campaign Committee, briskly encapsulated the Democrats’ closing message when she said: “When voters go to the polls on Tuesday, they know that if they wake up on Wednesday and there is Republican control in the state, there will be an abortion ban. Period.”           Control of both chambers will be decided primarily in relatively well-educated suburban House and Senate districts across the state, particularly in Northern and Central Virginia, around Washington, DC, and Richmond. The Post/Schar poll gave Democrats a roughly 25-point advantage in the former and a 10-point lead in the latter. If the state’s major suburban areas break for Democrats because of abortion, “that is basically the ballgame,” said Kondik.           If populous (and mostly prosperous) suburbs prove the bridge too far for Virginia Republicans, it would extend a striking pattern from other recent contests in which abortion has played a central role. In the seven states that have held ballot initiatives related to the issue since the Supreme Court’s 2022 decision, the side favoring abortion rights has consistently dominated the largest places.           In these ballot initiatives, abortion rights supporters carried all six of the counties that cast the most votes in Kansas, eight of the 10 counties that cast the most votes in Kentucky and Michigan, and the 14 largest in California. Even in Montana, which doesn’t have many population centers, an anti-abortion ballot measure lost in all three of the counties that cast the most votes. (A Vermont constitutional amendment protecting abortion rights in 2022 carried every town in the state.) In this summer’s first round of Ohio’s battle over abortion – a GOP-backed measure to make it more difficult to change the state’s Constitution – the abortion rights side carried 14 of the state’s 17 largest counties, including several that had voted for Trump in 2020, according to the results posted by The New York Times.     Abortion rights groups have been on a winning streak. Opponents hope Ohio’s Issue 1 offers a reset   Round two of Ohio’s confrontation over abortion will come Tuesday when voters will decide a ballot measure that would repeal a six-week ban on the procedure that the GOP legislature passed, and Republican Gov. Mike DeWine signed, in 2019. Some voters have been confused because both this summer’s proposed change to the state constitution and the current measure to repeal the abortion ban have been designated as Issue One, and the position in support of abortion rights was a “no” vote over the summer and is a “yes” vote now. But the limited polling available has found the measure likely to pass, largely because of preponderant support among urban and suburban voters.           Democrats are counting on similar metro support in two other races Tuesday in which abortion has loomed large: a state Supreme Court contest in Pennsylvania and Kentucky Democratic Gov. Andy Beshear’s reelection bid against Republican state Attorney General Daniel Cameron. When Beshear narrowly won a first term in the Republican-leaning state four years ago, he combined a strong performance in the state’s major population centers of Louisville and Lexington with an unusually competitive showing in smaller, blue-collar Eastern Kentucky counties. But Beshear will likely struggle to match his small town performance this year with hostility to Biden running high in those places.  Beshear this time is stressing his support for abortion rights, and if he wins, he will likely have relied even more on Kentucky’s largest counties, including several that are functionally suburbs of Cincinnati, just across the Ohio border.           The Pennsylvania Supreme Court election between Republican Carolyn Carluccio and Democrat Daniel McCaffery will likely follow a similar path. As Kondik and a colleague noted in a recent analysis, the most recent state Supreme Court election (in 2021) did not track Pennsylvania’s usual presidential patterns, which have seen Democrats gaining in major white-collar suburban areas around Philadelphia and Pittsburgh and Republicans advancing in the mostly blue-collar, smaller places between them. But with abortion and voting rights dominating the current race, Kondik said it is much more likely to follow the presidential map, which should provide Democrats the edge.           In all these ways, Tuesday’s elections may underscore the intractability of the geographic polarization that has reshaped American politics through the 21st century. In 2020, Biden won fully 91 of the nation’s 100 largest counties, while Trump carried over 2,500 of the remaining 3,000. Biden dominated all the hubs of the emerging information economy: According to tabulations by Brookings Metro, a nonpartisan think tank, Biden-won counties generated 71% of the nation’s total economic output, even though he captured  only one-sixth of counties overall. Trump romped in the nonmetro places that are home to much of the nation’s manufacturing, energy extraction and agriculture.     The 2022 election showed how difficult it was to dislodge these patterns. Despite the widespread discontent over Biden and the economy, Democrats in the key races maintained (or even enlarged) advantages in populous suburban counties outside Phoenix, Atlanta, Detroit, Philadelphia, Milwaukee and Madison, Wisconsin. Republicans continued to post strong numbers beyond those metro areas – and in some cases, Democrats suffered diminished margins in heavily minority inner-city neighborhoods where discontent over the economy is widespread. But the Democratic suburban gains allowed them to win seven of the nine governor’s and Senate races in Arizona, Georgia, Michigan, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin – the five states that decided the 2020 presidential race by switching from Trump in 2016 to Biden.           Dante Chinni, director of the American Communities Project at Michigan State University, said voters’ geographic separation into blue metros and red non-metros has enormous, possibly irreversible, momentum. That separation now reflects not only political choices, he noted, but also decisions by marketers, who reinforce the diverging demographic patterns by locating retail outlets and restaurants that appeal to the predominant groups in each region. Everyone now understands the underlying cultural differences between a community with a Whole Foods or a Panera Bread, and one with a Cracker Barrel. “A community develops in a certain way and attracts a certain kind of person with certain beliefs and the consumer marketing industry reads that pretty quickly and knows the things to put in those locations to appeal to those people,” Chinni said. “It seems to me everything that’s built into the system is designed to reinforce these differences.”           Both parties are uneasy about where this geographic resorting has left them. Many Democrats worry that their rural decline dangerously constricts the number of House and Senate seats they can realistically win. Many Republicans in turn worry that it’s a losing hand to trade gains in rural places that are stagnant or declining in population for losses in suburban areas that are growing. “It’s a trajectory that is not sustainable for Republicans,” said veteran Wisconsin GOP strategist Mark Graul. Referring to the major suburban county outside Milwaukee and a rural Western Wisconsin county, he added, “We can’t subtract three voters in Waukesha County for a voter in Trempealeau County. The math doesn’t work.”           The persistent public dissatisfaction with Biden’s performance on the economy, crime and other issues provides Republicans a powerful wedge to move voters in the major population centers away from Democrats. Tuesday’s major elections will test whether that discontent is sufficient to overcome the durable doubts in these places about the Trump-era GOP on issues relating to rights, personal freedoms and democracy. The results will offer the year’s last major ballot-box test of how voters are balancing those contrasting beliefs almost exactly one year before they pick the next president.    © 2023 Cable News Network.

politics,Trump’s day in court paints a dark preview of the national ordeal ahead,https://edition.cnn.com/2023/11/07/politics/trump-court-appearance-2024-election-season/index.html,"       The judge in Donald Trump’s civil fraud trial despairingly pressed the ex-president’s lawyer: “I beseech you to control him if you can.”           Judge Arthur Engoron’s plea reflected his frustration at an incorrigible witness who boasted Monday about his piles of cash, aimed scathing political attacks and spouted uniquely illogical logic.           But Engoron, who is presiding over the New York trial, also put his finger on a deeper question that will define a singular political figure’s place in history.           And the answer, as always, was no, Trump cannot be controlled.           No mere lawyer could impose the kind of discipline that two-and-a-half centuries of constitutional checks and balances could not provide during Trump’s time in office or since. And after threatening to dismiss the ex-president from the witness stand, Engoron opted to let the Trump storm rage in the apparent hope that it would blow itself out — though history has shown it never does.           Trump’s combative defense against claims he inflated his wealth to rip off banks, insurance firms and New York state, served as a troubling preview of a 2024 election season that is likely to become ensnared with his massive legal peril. But it also revealed insights into Trump’s relentless refusal to give an inch to his enemies and showed why voters who despise East Coast authority figures and liberal societal codes adore him.           His testimony offered warnings to lawyers who will seek to puncture his self-created bubble of alternative realities with facts and evidence — and showed how he might try to charm and confuse jurors in his coming criminal trials.           As he climbed into the witness box and lifted his hand and swore to tell the truth — an almost ironic act given his record of falsehoods — Trump obliterated yet another convention. Ex-presidents in America don’t typically get called to explain their actions in court. And Monday’s four-hour dive into the Trump Organization’s financial records was just a warm up for subsequent criminal courtroom dramas that could mean the Republican Party will nominate a convicted felon for president. Trump denies wrongdoing in each and every case against him.           Trump in a blue suit, tie and shirt instead of his campaign livery of dark suit, white shirt and improbably long red tie, left no doubt that if tearing down legal and political systems is what it will take to save him, he won’t hesitate.           “It is election interference because you want to keep me in this courthouse all day long,” Trump told prosecutors working for New York Attorney General Letitia James, accusing her of trying to base a run for governor on an attempt to destroy his business. As he often does, the ex-president was turning facts upside down — it is he who is politicizing the justice system in his own bid for a return to power.           And before he faces judgment, Trump is seeking to discredit the organs of accountability that will seal his fate. “It is an extremely hostile judge,” Trump added, raising his hand to point at Engoron, who sat beside and just above the witness box on the bench.           The ex-president’s day was a microcosm of a riotous life as a real estate magnate, New York City icon, showbiz reality star and demagogic political candidate and US president. He obstructed, exaggerated, spouted insults, brassily trampled courtroom protocol and substituted partisan narratives for the yes and no answers that the judge demanded. Yet Trump also expertly used the outraged stream of consciousness and linguistic dexterity that turns his interrogators in the law, or the media, in knots.           There were even flashes of humor, hinting at one of the key ingredients of the political method that has seduced millions of Americans. Asked, for instance, whether he had built houses on a golf course in Scotland, Trump conceded that he had not but added waspishly: “I have a castle.” And there were oodles of quintessential Trump self-promotion. He boasted that his Florida Mar-a-Lago resort was “a very successful club,” said he’d built the “best building on the West Coast” and claimed dubiously that his 18 holes in Aberdeen was the “greatest golf course ever built.”           At one point, Trump mused: “I’ve had a lot of cash for a long time.”           Trump’s supporters could not watch him since the trial was not televised but they would have recognized the bulldozer on the witness stand and the blow-it-all-up persona that made a twice-impeached, four times indicted ex-president who left Washington in disgrace nearly three years ago again the Republican front-runner.           It became clear long before Trump left court complaining of a “scam” that his legal strategy was indistinguishable from his familiar political one: admit nothing and brand any criticism as proof of a vast, unfair plot against him. The goal was transparent: leverage the latest bid to call him to account into a campaign fueled by a martyr complex that can win back presidential powers to drive away his legal woes.           “People are sick and tired of what’s happening. I think it’s a very sad day for America,” Trump said at the end, before noting The New York Times polls showing him leading President Joe Biden in key swing states — a tactic his lawyer Chris Kise also used to imply the “soon to be” next president wasn’t being shown sufficient respect.           Yet Monday was also a rude awakening for Trump.           Retired commanders-in-chief are usually surrounded by a force field of deference, with their secret service detachments and forever title of “Mr. President.” Trump has long posed as the alpha male and his entire business and political creed — in person and on social media – is based on intimidation. But it must have been a long time since anyone had shushed Trump like Engoron, cutting him off ahead of another meander by saying, “No, no, you answered the question.”           There was no “Mr. President” from the attorney general’s lawyers or the judge. The witness was simply “Mr. Trump.” He sat on a leather chair, alone in the wood paneled witness box, his hands clasped in his lap.           But the trial quickly became a test of wills between Trump and Engoron over who controlled the court. After one trip by Trump down a rabbit hole, the judge asked the lawyers if they had asked for an “essay” on brand value. Frustrated with partisan asides, Engoron warned that “this is not a political rally, this is a courtroom.” And the judge bristled at the ex-president’s complaint that he always ruled against him. Adopting a tone typical of Trump subordinates, Kise argued with the judge’s admonitions against speeches and lauded the ex-president’s “brilliant” replies.           Later, the judge, perhaps trying to avoid offering grist for a potential appeal said he’d let the ex-president ramble. But by the end of the day, Engoron’s resolve frayed: “It feels like a broken record,” he said of Trump’s answers. The ex-president snapped back: “He keeps asking me the same question over and over.” Engoron will however get the last word. He has already ruled that Trump, his two adult sons and the Trump Organization are liable for fraud in inflating his wealth in return for advantageous deals with banks and insurance firms. The trial will resolve related claims and decide how much restitution is due and whether he will be barred from doing business in New York.           It was hard to tell whether Trump had helped or hurt himself. He did appear to disrupt the smooth running of the trial. But – as he complained at one point – there is no jury, and Engoron will be left to adjudicate the trial.           Trump’s defense broadly rested on three planks. He denied accusations that he’d inflated his properties, insisting conversely that he’d undervalued most of them by not including ill-defined millions of dollars implied by his “brand” and its potential. He claimed that he was protected by a disclaimer clause in financial documents, which meant that banks and insurance firms had to do their own due diligence. And he repeatedly insisted that “there were no victims,” so there can have been no crime.           This blanket deniability and belief in his own imperviousness echoed Trump’s false proclamations in office that the Constitution granted him almost absolute powers. Or that the phone call with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky that earned him his first impeachment or his January 6, 2021 speech before the Capitol insurrection were “perfect.”           Trump also offered an intriguing glimpse into his mindset as a businessman that makes it easier to understand his false insistence that he actually won the 2020 election when he clearly lost it.           “I can look at a building and tell you what they are worth,” he said, creating the impression that the true valuation of a property was something he could just pluck out of the air, with little regard for all the complex financial instruments that normally add up to an investment’s true value. This desire to make a reality just what he wants it to be has long defined Trump’s political approach. And he seems to adopt a similar tactic in looking at an election and deciding who won regardless of the actual evidence about who got the most votes.           This question of whether Trump actually believes what he says will be key to two election interference trials — one in federal court in Washington and one in Georgia where prosecutors must show he intended to break the law. Trump insists that he was convinced he won in 2020, despite all evidence to the contrary. And in his virtual reality world, he may believe it or may at least be able to convince a jury he did.           But the most sobering takeaway of Trump’s day in court on Monday was that while the law might succeed in enforcing accountability where constitutional and political constraints failed, there is no sign yet that anyone or anything can bring the potential 47th president of the United States under control.    © 2023 Cable News Network.

politics,Trump heads to the witness stand as new polls show him leaping past Biden in key swing states,https://edition.cnn.com/2023/11/06/politics/trump-fraud-trial-biden-polls/index.html,"       A year away from Election Day 2024, former President Donald Trump is set to testify in a civil fraud trial and separately faces more than 90 criminal charges, setting up the possibility that a convicted felon tops the Republican ticket next November.           But it’s President Joe Biden’s political prospects that are plunging.           In another extraordinary twist to a 2024 campaign season that is more notable for court hearings than treks through early voting states, Trump is expected to be called to the witness stand in New York on Monday. This is hardly typical activity during a post-presidency. But Trump was, after all, the most unconventional president.           Biden, meanwhile, is absorbing brutal new polls showing him losing to GOP front-runner Trump in multiple key swing states. The numbers will likely ignite panic among Democrats and renew doubts among Americans that the soon-to-be-81-year-old is up to a full second term. If the New York Times/Siena College survey is borne out in 2024, there would be no electoral path to victory for Biden. And an increasingly authoritarian Trump – who is promising a second term of “retribution” – could pull off a White House comeback in spite of sparking a Capitol insurrection with his false claims of electoral fraud in 2020.     Trump leads Biden in 4 key swing states, new polling finds         “I was concerned before these polls, and I’m concerned now,” Democratic Sen. Richard Blumenthal of Connecticut told CNN’s Dana Bash on “State of the Union” on Sunday.           “These presidential races over the last couple of terms have been very tight. No one is going to have a runaway election here. It’s going to take a lot of hard work, concentration, resources. And so we have our work cut out for us.”           The coinciding crises facing both Trump and Biden belie the fact that, for all their deficiencies, neither is yet to face a serious challenger from within their parties as they seek the nomination.           Biden’s position is weakening as he tackles cascading global threats such as the war in the Middle East, sheds support over his handling of the economy and sees cracks in the multiracial coalition that first elected him. It also reflects a nation that is divided and disconsolate, and groping for the elusive normality that the president promised three years ago after the pandemic and the historic turbulence of the Trump administration.           The poll is also sure to renew the question of whether Biden is right to insist on running again, although some Democrats argue the time to coalesce around a different candidate may have already passed.     As Trump’s legal and political schedules collide, his lawyers and campaign staff manage the chaos         “It’s very late to change horses,” David Axelrod, a former senior strategist for President Barack Obama and a CNN senior political analyst, wrote on X, formerly known as Twitter. Axelrod said that Biden had defied conventional wisdom before but that the latest polls would send “tremors of doubt thru the party.”           Trump’s strength in the New York Times polls and other surveys will meanwhile trigger anxiety around the world as realization dawns that a second Trump term could shatter the post-World War II system of Western alliances and effectively hand Ukraine to Russian President Vladimir Putin.           Polls in the modern era are rarely a failsafe predictor this far out from an election and provide only a snapshot. Multiple events that will shape the 2024 race are yet to take place.           Biden supporters argue that his critics and media narratives set by the president’s low polls badly miss the most salient point that will define the 2024 election. Once the binary choice between Biden and Trump becomes clear, they say, the electorate will inevitably side with a president whose warnings in the midterms last year that Republicans could crush US democracy were far more successful than pundits expected.           And the economy – which is strong fundamentally in terms of jobs and growth – could turn more in Biden’s favor in the next 12 months with all eyes on high prices and interest rates.           The impact of third-party candidates on the election and the way in which a chaotic House GOP could shape voter sentiment are also unknown factors.           And while Trump’s devoted followers have bought into his claims that his criminal peril is all political persecution by the Biden administration, there is no precedent for the staggering prospect of an ex-president and potential nominee on trial in an election year.           The New York Times/Siena College poll finds that around 6% of voters across Arizona, Georgia, Nevada, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin say they would switch their votes from Trump to Biden if the former president is convicted and sentenced. Given the tiny margins in these swing states in 2020 and expectations of a similarly tight race next year, such a shift could decide the election.           The biggest test yet of Trump’s strategy of turning his criminal peril into electoral advantage will unfold in a New York courtroom on Monday.           Americans simply are not used to the idea of their former leaders going under oath on the witness stand. It’s a scenario more familiar in fragile developing states abroad rather than in the world’s most powerful democracy. Because this is a civil trial, Trump has no criminal liability. But the judge has already ruled that Trump, his adult sons and the Trump Organization committed “persistent and repeated” fraud. Now the judge is considering a claim by New York Attorney General Letitia James for $250 million and a ban on Trump doing business in the state where he made his name.           While the trial is not televised, Trump has characteristically sought to turn his appearances in court into an all-consuming drama with his rants outside the courtroom about unfairness and his searing attacks on James, the judge and courtroom staff that have raised fears for their safety. The ex-president is seeking to destroy the credibility of the court system that seeks to hold him to account. His strategy shows that he remains even more of a threat to America’s democratic system than he was when he stormed out of Washington after failing to thwart Biden’s election victory.     What to watch when Donald Trump takes the stand in New York civil fraud trial         Testifying under oath is a tricky business for an ex-president renowned for making false claims. The law offers less impunity than he enjoys in spouting falsehoods on the campaign trail. Still, Trump is also defending his cherished business, his legacy and his family’s future. Temidayo Aganga-Williams, former senior investigative counsel of the House January 6 committee, says that the ex-president’s demeanor might depend on how his legal team think the case is going.           “We’ve seen the Donald Trump of the rallies, who is boisterous, who is offensive, who is aggressive, and then we’ve seen a Donald Trump, in deposition testimony, who was a little bit actually more controlled, about his words, who gets a little slightly more soft-spoken,” Aganga-Williams told CNN’s Kaitlan Collins on Friday. “If they think all is lost, they may decide to go in a more aggressive, public-facing strategy, where it’s not about what’s happening with the verdict.”           Trump’s defenses in his areas of criminal liability have morphed with an campaign strategy founded on his repeated and false claims that the 2020 election was stolen. The ex-president is facing a federal trial beginning March in Washington arising from his attempt to overturn the election in 2020. He and associates have also been indicted in Fulton County, Georgia, on racketeering charges related to the election. Trump was also indicted by special counsel Jack Smith for the alleged mishandling of classified documents he kept at his Florida resort after leaving office. And he’s facing trial over his first criminal indictment in a New York case arising out of a hush-money payment to an adult-film star.           But according to Trump, this is all a new bout of election interference ahead of 2024. He warned in a fundraising email to supporters Sunday, exactly a year from Election Day, that if Biden and the Democrats win, “This will go on forever and ever – and America will NEVER have a genuine election again.”           Given that the likely Republican presidential nominee faces potential conviction, after having served a single term in the White House that was capped off with a second impeachment over his involvement in an insurrection, the question for Biden ought to be: Why is the nascent 2024 race even close?     The poll from The New York Times and Siena College suggests Trump has created an edge over Biden on the economy, immigration, national security and the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. Biden, however, is trusted more on abortion – a potential driver for Democratic turnout and a problem for the GOP in 2024.           In Nevada, which Biden narrowly won in 2020, Trump leads 52% to Biden’s 41%. Trump leads in Georgia, a state where he is facing racketeering charges, 49% to Biden’s 43%. The ex-president up 49% to 44% in Arizona, another key state. In Michigan, which Trump won in 2016 and Biden won in 2020, the Republican is up 5 points.     Biden aides grapple with 2024 outreach as Israel-Hamas war exposes cracks in coalition         The poll shows Biden weakening among Black and Hispanic voters. And 71% of those polled said he was too old to be an effective president, while only 39% said the same of Trump – who is 77.           Spencer Weiss, a Pennsylvania voter quoted by The Times who backed Biden in 2020 but now supports Trump, said: “The world is falling apart under Biden.” He added: “I would much rather see somebody that I feel can be a positive role-model leader for the country. But at least I think Trump has his wits about him.”           The Biden campaign scoffed at polls a year ahead of the election and argued that “our winning, popular agenda” would win out over “MAGA Republicans’ unpopular extremism.” But there were real signs of anxiety among Democrats on Sunday.           In addition to Blumenthal, Rep. Pramila Jayapal, chair of the Congressional Progressive Caucus, warned that Biden was suffering over his staunch support for Israel despite its relentless pounding of Gaza after the Hamas terror attacks on October 7. The Washington state lawmaker told Jen Psaki on MSNBC that for the “first time” she thought Biden’s reelection hopes were “in great trouble” because “Muslim Americans, Arab Americans, but also young people, see this conflict as a moral conflict and a moral crisis.”     This story has been updated with additional information.  © 2023 Cable News Network.

politics,Virginia elections offer the most important test for both parties heading into 2024,https://edition.cnn.com/2023/11/04/politics/virginia-elections-test-republicans-democrats-2024/index.html,"       If you’re like most Americans, you couldn’t care less about elections held the year before a presidential contest.           Only a few states – all with relatively small populations – have statewide contests for elective offices this year. Virginia and New Jersey are holding elections for their state legislatures. Ohio voters will decide on two ballot initiatives. And several cities will be electing mayors.           But before you dismiss Tuesday’s elections out of hand, I want to draw your attention to what will be perhaps the last best test for both parties heading into 2024.           Election results for the Virginia Legislature over the past few cycles have been shown to correlate with what happens in the following year’s national elections. So a good showing for either party Tuesday would bode well for that party next year.           Consider what happened in 2019. Democrats were able to flip both chambers of the Virginia Legislature. The following year Democrat Joe Biden won the presidency.           In 2021, Republicans retook the Virginia House. That was followed by the GOP winning back the US House of Representatives in 2022.           The Virginia Senate wasn’t up in 2021 – state senators face their voters every four years. Still, the party that controls the Virginia Senate going into the presidential election has gone on to win the presidency every year but once since 1999. That one time was in 2011, when the two parties ended up tied in the state Senate, with the Republican lieutenant governor serving as the tie-breaker.     These candidates in Virginia could shape how both parties talk about abortion in 2024         This year, both parties are in position to win control of either one or both legislative bodies in Virginia. Democrats hold the thinnest of majorities in the state Senate, while Republicans narrowly control the state House.           An October Washington Post-Schar poll found Democrats with a 2-point advantage – well within the margin of error – on the generic House ballot in Virginia. (The generic ballot usually asks respondents some form of the following question: “If the elections for the Legislature were held today, would you vote for the Democratic or Republican party?)           That 2-point edge is a far cry from 2019, when Democrats easily won the popular vote for both the Virginia House and Senate. Still, it’s better than Democrats’ 2021 performance in the state House popular vote. And it makes sense given what we’re seeing in national surveys. The two front-runners for their party nominations – Biden and former President Donald Trump – are close in the 2024 polls.           The electoral landscape in Virginia appears to be very different from what we’ve seen in the legislative and congressional special elections so far in 2023. In those elections, Democrats have been greatly outperforming the Democratic baseline (measured by comparing their candidates’ performances with Biden’s in 2020).           It’s an open question, though, as to why the typically low-turnout special elections have been favorable to Democrats. Is it just because Democrats have been very revved up to vote following the overturning of Roe v. Wade, but that voters who will cast ballots in higher-turnout elections will be more favorable to Republicans?           If that’s the case, then these special election results likely don’t tell us much about next year’s electoral outcome. The 2020 presidential election had the highest turnout most of us have seen in our lifetimes, and 2024 probably won’t be too different.           Virginia likely won’t experience the problem of low turnout this year to the same degree as these special elections. Both parties are spending big in the state. There will be 140 state legislative elections happening at the same time Tuesday. That’s important because any single election could be an outlier (e.g., one really bad candidate could throw things off in an individual district).           Speaking of money, a lot of it is focused on ads that could preview the messages each party will try to capitalize on next year. Democrats have been especially focused on abortion. Will their abortion rights message carry the day? Will it be enough to save them even as Biden remains unpopular and Republican Gov. Glenn Youngkin is well liked in the state?           If Virginia Democrats do well, expect their party colleagues across the country to try to replicate that effort next year when Biden is officially on the ballot.           But if Democrats are unable to succeed in a state Biden won by 10 points, what would that say about the president’s chances on far-less-fertile swing-state ground?

politics,Trump unleashes new attack on the legal system after his adult sons take the stand,https://edition.cnn.com/2023/11/03/politics/trump-legal-system-attack-sons-trial/index.html,"       It was a rough day in court for the Trump boys.           But even before Donald Jr. and Eric had wrapped up an unconvincing day of testimony in a New York civil fraud trial, their father erupted.           “So sad to see my sons being PERSECUTED in a political Witch Hunt by this out of control, publicity seeking, New York State Judge, on a case that should have NEVER been brought,” ex-President Donald Trump posted on his Truth Social. “Legal Scholars Scream Disgrace!”     Takeaways from the tense testimony of Eric Trump and Donald Trump Jr. in the New York fraud case         The ex-president was wasting no time in firing up the classic divert, discredit and delay defense strategy that he’s deploying across his staggeringly broad legal exposure that includes four looming criminal trials weighing on his 2024 White House bid.           Trump’s latest blast against Judge Arthur Engoron, who has already found Trump, his two adult sons and their family empire – the Trump Organization – liable for fraud, also served as a preemptive blow ahead of the ex-president’s own expected testimony in the civil trial in the courtroom on Monday. The sometimes strange goings on at the court in New York are offering early insight into how the even more high-profile and criminal cases facing Trump could play out in an unprecedented election year when the campaign trail will run through the courts as well as key swing states.           Trump’s legal defense has become indistinguishable from his presidential campaign as he struggles to cope with accountability imposed by courtroom procedures but portrays himself as a victim of political hounding. Just as he tarnished the reputation of the US electoral system among millions of his supporters with false claims of election fraud, the ex-president is now seeking to trash the image of another pillar of American democracy: the courts. And characteristically, he is accusing President Joe Biden, his Justice Department and various prosecutors of being guilty of the very transgression that he himself perpetrated as he portrays the cases against him as “Election Interference.”           Trump put his two adult sons in charge of his real estate firm when he became president, but despite their positions of authority, both insisted they had very little to do with dealing with their father’s financial statements, which were used in securing loans on the firm’s behalf.           “That’s not the focus of my day. I focus on construction. I don’t focus on appraisals,” Eric Trump said at one point, after a long exchange in which Assistant New York Attorney General Andrew Amer tried to show his deep involvement in the affairs of a development at a Trump golf course in New York.           The case rests on claims that Trump, his sons and their firm inflated statements of the ex-president’s personal wealth to get financial benefits in loan and insurance policies worth tens of millions of dollars. The case is a civil one and does not allege criminal behavior but could result in heavy financial restitution and end the company’s capacity to do business in New York. It’s therefore critical to Trump’s own financial health, his legacy and the future prospects of his family.           Things grew heated when Amer apparently succeeded in undermining Eric Trump’s claims that he had little to do with his father’s financial statements. “I understand we had financials as a company,” Eric Trump said. But he added: “I was not personally aware of the statement of financial condition.” Amer, however, showed him an email he was sent in 2013 from the firm’s former financial controller Jeff McConney who asked him to value a property that included a supporting data spreadsheet.           “So you did know about your father’s annual financial statement, as of August 20, 2013, didn’t you?” Amer asked. Eric Trump replied: “It appears that way, yes.”           In essence, both Trump sons are arguing that despite running the company, they knew nothing about its financial statements.           Earlier, Donald Trump Jr. had insisted that he was similarly unaware about details of his father’s finances – despite signing off on them – and that he relied on accountants to worry about the details. After his own testimony concluded he strolled out of court, saying it went “really well.” Blatantly and brazenly disregarding evidence that clearly contradicts such assertions is another time-worn Trump tactic. After the ex-president was impeached over an account of a telephone conversation with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky that showed him trying to leverage US military aid for a political benefit, the former president repeatedly insisted that he had conducted “a perfect call.”           Outside the courtroom Thursday, Donald Trump Jr. also dipped into his father’s bag of political tricks by portraying himself as the innocent target of a witch-hunt.           “I think it went really well, if we were actually dealing with logic and reason the way business is conducted,” he said, adding that “unfortunately the AG has brought forth a case that is purely a political persecution.”           Engoron has already ruled against the Trumps on one of the claims at issue — persistent and repeated fraud — so the trial is about various other claims of conspiracy and falsifying business records. It will also decide how much the Republican front-runner and his companies could be forced to pay in restitution.           Before court ended for the day on Thursday, Trump’s legal team also resorted to another familiar tactic — targeting court staff and the judge in order to build a conceit that the entire trial is unfair and the legal system that appears likely to deliver a damning judgment against him is corrupt.           Two Trump lawyers raised questions about the conduct of the judge’s clerk — who Trump has also attacked online, earning fines for infringing a gag order. Engoron commented that there could be “a bit of misogyny” in criticism of the female clerk. In a bizarre passage of the trial, Trump attorney Chris Kise insisted: “I’m not a misogynist. I’m very happily married, and I have a 17-year-old daughter.” Then his colleague Alina Habba rose to defend her colleague and insisted he wasn’t a misogynist. The Trump team has accused the clerk of co-judging the case, much to Trump’s anger.           CNN legal analyst Shan Wu said that neither the testimony of Eric Trump nor the strategy of attacking court personnel seemed like a smart approach.           “This tactic of … trying to totally distance themselves, saying that they know nothing about the financial statements, plus the admission that came out from Eric – I think it really hurts their credibility,” Wu said on “The Situation Room.”           Referring to the objections to Engoron’s clerk, Wu added: “It is unfathomable to me why his defense counsel are using that kind of tactic here.”           Another Trump – Ivanka, the ex-president’s eldest daughter – has been trying to avoid testifying next week in the case after she was dismissed as a defendant. In a late Thursday filing, her lawyer argued that she would suffer an “undue hardship” if made to travel from her home in Florida, where she lives with three minor children, to appear in the middle of a school week.           A higher court, however, swiftly denied the bid to block the order for her testimony and pause the trial until an appeal could be heard by the New York appellate court.           Another quintessential Trump legal strategy is again in operation in Washington, DC, as his lawyers seek to delay his trial in the federal election interference case — possibly until after an election that could hand Trump the power to end or disrupt many legal threats against him if he becomes the 47th President.           Trump’s legal team on Wednesday asked Judge Tanya Chutkan to delay a trial scheduled to take place in March — during the heat of the GOP primary race — as the legal system works through his bid to get the case dismissed on the grounds that he’s immune from prosecution on any actions he took while president. His attorneys also this week asked a judge in Florida to delay the trial in a case over the ex-president’s handling of classified documents until after November’s election.           Trump’s team is entitled to exhaust all possible legal avenues as they prepare for his trials since the integrity of the legal system rests on defendants getting a fair hearing and wielding every potential remedy. Even so, during his long business and political career, Trump’s legal maneuverings often seem designed to tie courts in knots and to delay accountability while mocking the spirit of those protections.           And the idea that a president is free from legal accountability for anything he does in office would have grave implications to the bedrock principles of constrained presidential power and the idea that everyone is equal under the law.           It would pave the way for a second potential Trump term that tests the constitutional limits on executive power even more than the first one. Trump, who is showing increasingly autocratic instincts on the campaign trail, has already promised his supporters a new term would be devoted to political “retribution.”    © 2023 Cable News Network.

politics,Israel aid drama is the latest failure of American governance,https://edition.cnn.com/2023/11/02/politics/israel-aid-drama-congress/index.html,"       The House’s struggle to send $14 billion in emergency aid to Israel is exposing political rifts that leave America looking like a divided superpower unable even to rush help to a friend that believes it’s fighting an existential war.           House GOP leaders said they plan to hold a vote on the package on Thursday but such is the uncertainty in the party’s chaotic majority that no timetable is ever certain. And the country’s political schisms and a fractured foreign policy consensus are increasingly threatening to paralyze governing and hamper US goals abroad.           But House GOP Whip Tom Emmer and House Majority Leader Steve Scalise both said they expect to pass the package later in the day.           It shouldn’t be this hard.           For years, a vote on aid to Israel might have been one of the least controversial measures to come up in the House all year. But delays in moving the measure, the fragile balance of power in Washington and feuds between and inside both parties over the new Middle East war show that there’s no longer any easy vote.           The commotion around the issue largely centers on newly elected House Speaker Mike Johnson’s decision to pay for the $14.3 billion in aid to Israel with an equal amount of cuts from the budget of the Internal Revenue Service. This is popular with conservatives but means that many Democrats will vote against what they see as a political stunt.     Why the GOP plan to cut IRS funds to pay for Israel aid would increase the deficit         But Johnson defended his decision on Thursday to link Israel aid to cuts in IRS funding. “I did not attach that for political purposes, OK. I attached it because, again, we’re trying to get back to the principle of fiscal responsibility here,” the speaker told reporters. “And that was the easiest and largest pile of money that’s sitting there for us to be able to pay for this immediate obligation.”           The Israel package is also being dragged deeper into the political mire because President Joe Biden chose to include it in a much broader request that includes the next tranche of arms and ammunition for Ukraine. Johnson’s conference opposes some aspects of the ask for funding north of $100 billion. And while the speaker is moving an Israel bill on its own, the Senate may insert Ukraine aid and send it back to the House, further delaying the dispatch of US assistance to Israel amid its war with Hamas.           The debate is revealing multiple subplots in national politics a year out from the next election. And it is painting exactly the kind of picture of American dysfunction that adversaries like China and Russia leverage in their attempts to weaken US power.     — Johnson’s strategy shows how an extreme right-wing GOP conference is ready to play hardline politics even on issues that have a critical global impact. His decision to include IRS offsets also makes clear that like his ousted predecessor Kevin McCarthy, the Louisiana Republican cannot guarantee a functioning GOP majority without making concessions to its most hardline members. But these moves are unlikely ever to be accepted by the Democratic-led White House or Senate so they are ultimately futile. For instance, Biden has already vowed to veto the current House bill in the unlikely event it ever reaches him. But Johnson is going ahead — already raising the possibility that he’s being led by extreme elements of his party rather than the other way around.     — The speaker could emerge strengthened if he is able to navigate the bill into law without further delays. But he also risks navigating himself into a position that ruptures his authority before he has built an effective political foundation. While his IRS gambit could win sufficient GOP votes to pass the bill, it won’t change the reality of shared power in Washington. Sooner or later he’ll have to produce a measure that can win support in a Democratic-run White House and Senate. That could require him to rely on some Democratic votes for final passage — the very scenario that outraged extreme right GOP members and led to the fall of McCarthy, causing three weeks of farcical power vacuums in the House. And if the vote timetable on Israel does slip, Johnson will waste even more time just two weeks ahead of a threatened government shutdown that can only be averted by a funding bill that will be even harder than an Israel measure to pass.     — The aid debate is also exposing the huge rift inside the Republican Party over foreign policy between Make America Great Again isolationists and the old school establishment that still advocates robust global leadership through alliances that helped secure global peace since World War II. Johnson’s maneuvering – in loading down the Israel bill with political priorities and separating it from Ukraine funding – has created a rift with Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell, a staunch conservative, but who is closer to Biden than his own party in the House on the issue. “Over and over again, history has taught us that the costs of disengaging from the world are far higher than the costs of engaging,” McConnell said Wednesday, before Johnson crossed the Capitol and lunched with Republican senators. “As foolish as it is to deny the clear link between America’s adversaries and the threats we face, it’s every bit as dangerous to pretend that as a global superpower, our nation could not or should not face each of them down.”     — As McConnell suggested, the related showdown over aid to Ukraine is also exposing the chasm inside the GOP and showcasing the broader question of whether the United States and its people are prepared to continue to be a bulwark for global democracy. This is a question at the core of a possible general election clash between Biden, an internationalist whose worldview was forged in the Cold War, and former President Donald Trump, a transactional leader who views alliances more as protection rackets than multipliers of American global power. After all, the fundamental question at issue on Ukraine is whether the US will continue to stand for the independence of a country whose right to exist is being threatened by a ruthless invasion planned in the Kremlin. Large numbers of Republicans in the House and an increasing number in the Senate do not view Ukraine as a vital US foreign policy interest — leaving some appearing to prefer Russian President Vladimir Putin to democracy in Kyiv.           Ukraine’s supporters in Congress saw some reason to hope, however, after Johnson on Wednesday attended the weekly Senate policy lunch. The Louisiana lawmaker has long expressed skepticism over Ukraine aid but appeared to indicate that he realized he had wider duties as speaker beyond his own political preferences. Johnson told Fox News last week that the US shouldn’t abandon Ukraine to Putin. Oklahoma Sen. Markwayne Mullin told reporters that the rookie speaker indicated an openness to passing Ukraine funding if it had support from House Republicans. And South Carolina Sen. Lindsey Graham, an advocate for helping the war-torn country, said he was “blown away” by the speaker’s foreign policy acumen. But the last few weeks have shown there’s a vast difference between what a GOP speaker wants to do and what he can do. There’s unlikely ever to be sufficient support to pass Ukraine funding by using the Republican majority alone. So he will be back to needing Democratic help that could fatally wound his speakership.     — While Republican schisms on foreign policy are getting most of the headlines, the domestic political aftershocks of Israel’s war with Hamas are becoming an increasing problem for Biden. Some prominent progressives are becoming more and more critical of Israel’s tactics in Gaza where hundreds of civilians have been killed in what Israel says are targeted raids against leaders of the Islamist militant group. The debate in the House chamber over the aid package for Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s government will drive Democratic tensions to the surface.           The president came face-to-face with such anger during a trip to Minnesota on Wednesday when a protester who identified herself to reporters as Rabbi Jessica Rosenberg started chanting “ceasefire now.” Biden explained that he favored a humanitarian pause in Israeli operations to allow time for the release of hostages in Gaza and said he understood the “emotion.” But he has refused to publicly call on Israel to agree to a ceasefire with Hamas, reasoning that it has a right to defend itself after the October 7 terrorist attacks that killed 1,400 people in Israel, most of them civilians.           The president is in a perilous political position a year ahead of the election, and can ill afford low turnout among progressive and Muslim voters who favor the Palestinians in swing states like Michigan. In an apparent sign the White House understands the potential political risks, the president unveiled plans for a new strategy to counter Islamophobia in the United States Wednesday. The initiative could expose Biden to attacks from Republicans at a time when the country is being rocked by growing antisemitism. But the conflict in the Middle East is leaving the president with a new set of tricky political hazards to navigate at home.

While the Trump family has spent time in a New York court answering questions about whether it inflated the value of its billions in real estate assets, the new House speaker, Louisiana Republican Rep. Mike Johnson, the man who is tasked with negotiating a must-pass government spending bill, reports no assets at all beyond his house.           Perhaps more surprising than suspicious, it’s an oddity that speaks to the fact that power in Washington frequently has nothing to do with personal wealth.           The New York court has already determined that illusion of value helped former President Donald Trump secure better terms on loans and insurance policies. Journalists and good-government groups, meanwhile, are wondering how it can be true that a man like Johnson, who just got a nearly $50,000 raise to make more than $223,000 per year, can really not have a savings account and may not have a retirement account.           Johnson said on Fox News on Sunday that before coming to Congress, he was a lawyer focused on nonprofit work and that his father was a firefighter.           Now, by day he’s the point person for passing trillions in government spending and by night has said he’s helping his five kids through college and graduate school on a government salary and, apparently, not much else.           CNN’s Sunlen Serfaty reports that a review by CNN of Johnson’s personal financial disclosures and campaign financial documents suggest that since coming to Congress in 2017, the new speaker appears to be living paycheck to paycheck. Like many lawmakers, he’s been sleeping in his office while in Washington and will apparently continue to do so for the time being, a source with knowledge told Serfaty.           Federal lawmakers are required to file an annual financial disclosure report, which lists assets, loans, income, stock sales and other transactions in broad terms.           Johnson does have a personal account, according to his office, but it doesn’t appear on the financial disclosure form because it is a noninterest-bearing account.           He’s also got multiple loans, including a mortgage of between $250,000 and $500,000, and a personal loan and a home equity line of credit (HELOC) each between $15,001 and $50,000, according to his 2022 financial disclosure form.           Teaching online classes for Liberty University in Virginia brought in nearly $30,000 last year. Values for his wife’s income from a Christian counseling company and also from her work for the Louisiana Right to Life Educational Committee are not listed. Read the two-page disclosure here.     Here’s why Social Security and Medicare advocates fear Mike Johnson’s speakership         In 2016, Johnson reported a retirement account with less than $15,000 that has not appeared on his financial records since. That account could have been rolled over into a Thrift Savings Plan – a form of retirement savings for federal employees – which Johnson reported from 2017 through 2020 and which he last reported was valued between $15,001 to $50,000.           Disclosures for the last two years make no mention of the account, which means that he could have cashed it out, that the account had less than $5,000 in it or simply that he stopped reporting it because reporting that type of account is not required.           If he stopped contributing to the account – and it’s not clear that he did – it would be a strange financial decision since the federal government matches employee contributions up to 5% of income.           The Washington Post economics columnist and CNN commentator Catherine Rampell writes that Johnson should release more information as a matter of transparency.           “Holding your family’s entire savings in a non-interest-bearing account is a strange choice for a high-income household, particularly during a period of high inflation,” she writes.           “But more important, this arrangement still leaves voters in the dark about Johnson’s financial well-being. Whatever Johnson’s motivation for managing his money this way, the effect is to obscure what his resources actually look like and whether he’s under the kind of financial strain that other parts of his disclosures might suggest.”           “I think that helps us be a better leader because we can relate to every hardworking American family,” Johnson said on Fox. “That’s who we are. And I think it governs and helps govern my decisions and how I lead.”           It’s fitting, then, that questions about Johnson’s assets, or lack thereof, dovetail with his first big test as House speaker: determining how to fund the government and approve aid for Israel and Ukraine.           So far, on that question of government spending, Johnson’s message from Republicans to the country at a Capitol Hill press conference this week was “trust us” and that Republicans would unveil a plan “in short order.”           In the same way that Johnson may be living paycheck to paycheck, the US government has been living from stopgap spending bill to stopgap spending bill.           The latest temporary funding bill lapses at 12:01 am ET on November 18, about a week from now unless lawmakers in Johnson’s Republican-controlled House, the Democrat-controlled Senate and the White House can agree to pass a spending bill. A partial government shutdown could result if there’s no agreement.           Both chambers have been working to pass the 12 individual spending bills that make up most discretionary spending, but they have not yet worked to reconcile their two versions and there is disagreement over how to approach President Joe Biden’s request for billions in aid to Israel and Ukraine.           In the past, lawmakers have either passed a short-term spending bill, known as a continuing resolution, to keep the government functioning while they spend more time on spending bills or they have lumped some combination of all 12 spending bills into one massive spending bill, an omnibus, to fund the government for the year.           One potential idea floated by Johnson is for a laddered approach of continuing resolutions, by which certain agencies would get funding that lapses over time rather than all at once. That might blunt the effect of a Congress blowing deadlines, but it would also lead to a nonstop spending debate.           Senate Democrats, led by Sen. Chuck Schumer of New York, are preparing their own version of another short-term spending bill just in case nothing materializes from the House in time.           Schumer warned Johnson on Thursday not to call for spending cuts at the last minute.           “Hard-right proposals, hard-right slashing cuts, hard-right poison pills that have zero support from Democrats will only make a shutdown more likely. I hope they don’t go down that path in the week to come,” Schumer said.

politics,Jonathan Ernst/Reuters,https://edition.cnn.com/2023/10/21/politics/fault-lines-biden-2024-israel/index.html,"       The escalating confrontation between Israel and Hamas is offering President Joe Biden a crucial opportunity to begin flipping the script on one of his most glaring vulnerabilities in the 2024 presidential race.           For months, polls have consistently shown that most Americans believe Biden’s advanced age has diminished his capacity to handle the responsibilities of the presidency. But many Democrats believe that Biden’s widely praised response to the Mideast crisis could provide him a pivot point to argue that his age is an asset because it has equipped him with the experience to navigate such a complex challenge.            “As you project forward, we are going to be able to argue that Joe Biden’s age has been central to his success because in a time of Covid, insurrection, Russian invasion of Ukraine, now challenges in the Middle East, we have the most experienced man ever as president,” said Democratic strategist Simon Rosenberg. “Perhaps having the most experienced person ever to go into the Oval Office was a blessing for the country. I think we are going to be able to make that argument forcefully.”           Biden unquestionably faces a steep climb to ameliorate the concern that he’s too old for the job. Political strategists in both parties agree that those public perceptions are largely rooted in reactions to his physical appearance – particularly the stiffness of his walk and softness of his voice – and thus may be difficult to reverse with arguments about his performance. In a CNN poll released last month, about three-fourths of adults said Biden did not have “the stamina and sharpness to serve effectively as president” and nearly as many said he does not inspire confidence. Even about half of Democrats said Biden lacked enough stamina and sharpness and did not inspire confidence, with a preponderant majority of Democrats younger than 45 expressing those critical views.           But the crisis in Israel shows the path Biden will probably need to follow if there’s any chance for him to transmute doubts about his age into confidence in his experience. Though critics on the left and right in American politics have raised objections, Biden’s response to the Hamas attack has drawn praise as both resolute and measured from a broad range of leaders across the ideological spectrum in both the US and Israel.             “Biden is in his element here where relationships matter and his team is experienced (meaning operationally effective) and thoughtful (meaning can see forests as well as trees),” James Steinberg, dean of the Johns Hopkins School of Advanced International Studies, and deputy secretary of state under former President Barack Obama, wrote in an email.           Similarly, David Friedman, who served as ambassador to Israel for then-President Donald Trump, declared late last week, on Fox News Channel no less, that “The Biden administration over the past 12-13 days has been great.”           These responses underscore the fundamental political paradox about Biden’s age, and the experience that derives from it. On the one hand, there’s no doubt that his age is increasing anxiety among Democrats about his capacity to serve as an effective candidate for the presidency in 2024; on the other, his experience is increasing Democratic faith in his capacity to serve as an effective president now.           While more Democrats have been openly pining for another, younger alternative to replace Biden as the party’s nominee next year, many party leaders argued that there was no one from the Democrats’ large 2020 field of presidential candidates, or even among the rising crop of governors and senators discussed as potential successors, that they would trust more at this moment than Biden.           “No one – not a one,” said Matt Bennett, executive vice president for public affairs at Third Way, an organization of centrist Democrats. “That is genuinely the case. And I get people’s uneasiness about him both because he’s old and he has low poll numbers. But that doesn’t mean he isn’t the best person for the job.”           Familiarity with an issue is no guarantee of success: Biden took office with a long-standing determination to end the American deployment in Afghanistan but still executed a chaotic withdrawal. But in responding to global challenges, Biden, who was first elected to the Senate in 1972, is drawing on half a century of dealing with issues and players around the world; even George H.W. Bush, the last president who arrived in office with an extensive foreign policy pedigree, had only about two decades of previous high-level exposure to world events.           This latest crisis has offered more evidence that Biden is more proficient at the aspects of the presidency that unfold offstage than those that occur in public. It’s probably not a coincidence that the private aspects of the presidency are the ones where experience is the greatest asset, while the public elements of the job are those where age may be the greatest burden.           Biden’s speeches about Ukraine, and especially his impassioned denunciations of the Hamas attack over the past two weeks, have drawn much stronger reviews than most of his addresses on domestic issues. (Bret Stephens, a conservative New York Times columnist often critical of Biden, wrote that his first speech after the attack “deserves a place in any anthology of great American rhetoric.”) In Biden’s nationally televised address about Israel and Ukraine on Thursday, he drew on a long tradition of presidents from both parties who presented American international engagement as the key to world stability, even quoting Franklin D. Roosevelt’s call during World War II for the US to serve as the “arsenal of democracy.”           But even when Biden was younger, delivering galvanizing speeches was never his greatest strength. No one ever confused him with Ronald Reagan, Bill Clinton or Barack Obama as a communicator and his performance as president hasn’t changed that verdict. Instead, Biden has been at his best when working with other leaders, at home and abroad, out of the public eye.            Biden, for instance, passed more consequential legislation than almost anyone expected during his first two years, but he did not do so by rallying public sentiment or barnstorming the country. Rather, in quiet meetings, he helped to orchestrate a surprisingly effective legislative minuet that produced bipartisan agreements on infrastructure and promoting semiconductor manufacturing before culminating in a stunning agreement with holdout Democratic Sen. Joe Manchin of West Virginia to pass an expansive package of clean energy and health care initiatives with Democrat votes alone.            “He’s showed a degree of political dexterity in managing the coalition that would have been very challenging for anyone else,” said Rosenberg. “His years of actually legislating, where he learned how to bring people together and hash stuff out, was really important in keeping the Democratic family together.”           To the degree Biden has succeeded in international affairs, it has largely been with the same formula of working offstage with other leaders, many of whom he’s known for years, around issues that he has also worked on for years. In the most dramatic example, that sort of private negotiation and collaboration has produced a surprisingly broad and durable international coalition of nations supporting Ukraine against Russia.           Biden’s effort to manage this latest Mideast crisis is centered on his attempts through private diplomacy to support Israel in its determination to disable Hamas, while minimizing the risk of a wider war and maintaining the possibility of diplomatic agreements after the fighting (including, most importantly, a rapprochement between Israel and Saudi Arabia meant to counter Iranian influence). Administration officials believe that the strong support that Biden has expressed for Israel, not only after the latest attack, but through his long career, has provided him with a credibility among the Israeli public that will increase his leverage to influence, and perhaps restrain, the decisions of Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu.           The president “wisely from the very moment of this horror show expressed unfettered solidarity with Israel and that allowed him to then go to Israel and behind closed doors continue the conversation, which I’m sure Secretary [Antony] Blinken started,” said one former senior national security official in the Biden administration, who asked to be anonymous while discussing the situation. That credibility, the former official said, allowed Biden to ask hard questions of the Israelis such as “‘Ok, you are going to send in ground troops and then what? We did shock and awe [in the second Iraq war] and then we found ourselves trapped without a plan. What are you doing? What’s the outcome? Who is going to control Gaza when you’re done whatever you are doing? At least stop and think about this.’”           In all these ways, the Israel confrontation offers Biden an opportunity to highlight the aspects of the presidency for which he is arguably best suited.  In the crisis’ first days, former President Trump also provided Biden exactly the sort of personal contrast Democrats want to create when Trump initially responded to the tragic Hamas attack by airing personal grievances against Netanyahu and criticizing the Israeli response to the attack. For some Democrats, Trump’s off-key response crystallized the contrast they want to present next year to voters: “Biden is quiet competence and Trump is chaos and it’s a real choice,” said Jenifer Fernandez Ancona, vice president and chief strategy officer at Way to Win, a liberal group that funds organizations and campaigns focusing on voters of color.           Ancona said Biden’s performance since the Hamas attack points to the case Democrats should be preparing to make to voters in 2024. “He’s been a workhorse not a show pony, but that’s something we can talk about,” she said. “You can show a picture of a president working quietly behind the scenes, you can tell a story of how he has your best interests at heart. It is what it is: he’s, what, 80? You can’t get around that. But I do think he has shown he has the capacity and strength and tenacity to do this job. He’s been doing it. So why shouldn’t he get a chance to keep doing it?”           Likewise, Rosenberg argues, “In my view you can’t separate his age from his successes as president. He’s been successful because of his age and experience not in spite of it, and we have to rethink that completely.”           Other Democrats, though, aren’t sure that Biden can neutralize concerns about his age by making a case for the benefits of his experience. One Democratic pollster familiar with thinking in the Biden campaign, who asked for anonymity while discussing the 2024 landscape, said that highlighting Biden’s experience would only produce limited value for him so long as most voters are dissatisfied with conditions in the country. “The problem with the experience side is that people feel bad,” the pollster said. “If people felt like his accomplishments improved things for them, they wouldn’t care about his age. … The problem with the age vs. experience [argument] is that experience has to produce results for them, but experience isn’t producing results.”           William Galston, a senior fellow at the Brookings Institution and long-time Democratic strategist, sees another limit to the experience argument. Like most Democrats, Galston believes that Biden’s response to the crisis has, in fact, demonstrated the value of his long track record on international issues. “This is where all of his instincts, honed by decades of experience, come into play,” Galston said. “He knows which people to call when; he knows whom to send where. As was the case in [Ukraine], this is the sort of episode where Biden is at his best.”           The problem, Galston argues, is that voters can see the value of Biden’s experience in dealing with world events today and still worry he could not effectively handle the presidency for another term. “It’s not a logical contradiction,” Galston said, for voters to believe that “‘Yes, over the first four years of his presidency, his experience proved its value, and he had enough energy and focus to be able to draw on it when he needed it’ and at the same time say, ‘I am very worried that over the next four years, in the tension between the advantages of experience and disadvantages of age, that balance is going to shift against him.’”           To assuage concerns about his capacity, Biden will need not only to “tell” voters about the value of his experience but to “show” them his vigor through a rigorous campaign schedule, Galston said. “The experience argument is necessary, but not sufficient,” Galston maintains. “In addition to that argument, assuming it can be made well and convincingly, I think he is going to have to show through his conduct of the campaign that he’s up for another four years.”           Biden’s trips into active war zones in Ukraine and Israel have provided dramatic images that his campaign is already using to make that case. As Galston suggests, the president will surely need to prove the point again repeatedly in 2024.           But most analysts agree that what the president most needs to demonstrate in the months ahead is not energy, but results. His supporters have reason for optimism that Biden’s carefully calibrated response to the Israel-Hamas hostilities will allow them to present him as a reassuring source of stability in an unstable world – in stark contrast to the unpredictability and chaos that Trump, his most likely 2024 opponent, perpetually generates. But Biden’s management of this volatile conflict will help him make that argument only if its outcome, in fact, promotes greater stability in the Middle East. If nothing else, Biden’s long experience has surely taught him how difficult stability will be to achieve in a region once again teetering on the edge of explosion.    © 2023 Cable News Network.

But the crisis in Israel shows the path Biden will probably need to follow if there’s any chance for him to transmute doubts about his age into confidence in his experience. Though critics on the left and right in American politics have raised objections, Biden’s response to the Hamas attack has drawn praise as both resolute and measured from a broad range of leaders across the ideological spectrum in both the US and Israel.             “Biden is in his element here where relationships matter and his team is experienced (meaning operationally effective) and thoughtful (meaning can see forests as well as trees),” James Steinberg, dean of the Johns Hopkins School of Advanced International Studies, and deputy secretary of state under former President Barack Obama, wrote in an email.           Similarly, David Friedman, who served as ambassador to Israel for then-President Donald Trump, declared late last week, on Fox News Channel no less, that “The Biden administration over the past 12-13 days has been great.”           These responses underscore the fundamental political paradox about Biden’s age, and the experience that derives from it. On the one hand, there’s no doubt that his age is increasing anxiety among Democrats about his capacity to serve as an effective candidate for the presidency in 2024; on the other, his experience is increasing Democratic faith in his capacity to serve as an effective president now.           While more Democrats have been openly pining for another, younger alternative to replace Biden as the party’s nominee next year, many party leaders argued that there was no one from the Democrats’ large 2020 field of presidential candidates, or even among the rising crop of governors and senators discussed as potential successors, that they would trust more at this moment than Biden.           “No one – not a one,” said Matt Bennett, executive vice president for public affairs at Third Way, an organization of centrist Democrats. “That is genuinely the case. And I get people’s uneasiness about him both because he’s old and he has low poll numbers. But that doesn’t mean he isn’t the best person for the job.”           Familiarity with an issue is no guarantee of success: Biden took office with a long-standing determination to end the American deployment in Afghanistan but still executed a chaotic withdrawal. But in responding to global challenges, Biden, who was first elected to the Senate in 1972, is drawing on half a century of dealing with issues and players around the world; even George H.W. Bush, the last president who arrived in office with an extensive foreign policy pedigree, had only about two decades of previous high-level exposure to world events.           This latest crisis has offered more evidence that Biden is more proficient at the aspects of the presidency that unfold offstage than those that occur in public. It’s probably not a coincidence that the private aspects of the presidency are the ones where experience is the greatest asset, while the public elements of the job are those where age may be the greatest burden.           Biden’s speeches about Ukraine, and especially his impassioned denunciations of the Hamas attack over the past two weeks, have drawn much stronger reviews than most of his addresses on domestic issues. (Bret Stephens, a conservative New York Times columnist often critical of Biden, wrote that his first speech after the attack “deserves a place in any anthology of great American rhetoric.”) In Biden’s nationally televised address about Israel and Ukraine on Thursday, he drew on a long tradition of presidents from both parties who presented American international engagement as the key to world stability, even quoting Franklin D. Roosevelt’s call during World War II for the US to serve as the “arsenal of democracy.”           But even when Biden was younger, delivering galvanizing speeches was never his greatest strength. No one ever confused him with Ronald Reagan, Bill Clinton or Barack Obama as a communicator and his performance as president hasn’t changed that verdict. Instead, Biden has been at his best when working with other leaders, at home and abroad, out of the public eye.            Biden, for instance, passed more consequential legislation than almost anyone expected during his first two years, but he did not do so by rallying public sentiment or barnstorming the country. Rather, in quiet meetings, he helped to orchestrate a surprisingly effective legislative minuet that produced bipartisan agreements on infrastructure and promoting semiconductor manufacturing before culminating in a stunning agreement with holdout Democratic Sen. Joe Manchin of West Virginia to pass an expansive package of clean energy and health care initiatives with Democrat votes alone.            “He’s showed a degree of political dexterity in managing the coalition that would have been very challenging for anyone else,” said Rosenberg. “His years of actually legislating, where he learned how to bring people together and hash stuff out, was really important in keeping the Democratic family together.”           To the degree Biden has succeeded in international affairs, it has largely been with the same formula of working offstage with other leaders, many of whom he’s known for years, around issues that he has also worked on for years. In the most dramatic example, that sort of private negotiation and collaboration has produced a surprisingly broad and durable international coalition of nations supporting Ukraine against Russia.           Biden’s effort to manage this latest Mideast crisis is centered on his attempts through private diplomacy to support Israel in its determination to disable Hamas, while minimizing the risk of a wider war and maintaining the possibility of diplomatic agreements after the fighting (including, most importantly, a rapprochement between Israel and Saudi Arabia meant to counter Iranian influence). Administration officials believe that the strong support that Biden has expressed for Israel, not only after the latest attack, but through his long career, has provided him with a credibility among the Israeli public that will increase his leverage to influence, and perhaps restrain, the decisions of Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu.           The president “wisely from the very moment of this horror show expressed unfettered solidarity with Israel and that allowed him to then go to Israel and behind closed doors continue the conversation, which I’m sure Secretary [Antony] Blinken started,” said one former senior national security official in the Biden administration, who asked to be anonymous while discussing the situation. That credibility, the former official said, allowed Biden to ask hard questions of the Israelis such as “‘Ok, you are going to send in ground troops and then what? We did shock and awe [in the second Iraq war] and then we found ourselves trapped without a plan. What are you doing? What’s the outcome? Who is going to control Gaza when you’re done whatever you are doing? At least stop and think about this.’”           In all these ways, the Israel confrontation offers Biden an opportunity to highlight the aspects of the presidency for which he is arguably best suited.  In the crisis’ first days, former President Trump also provided Biden exactly the sort of personal contrast Democrats want to create when Trump initially responded to the tragic Hamas attack by airing personal grievances against Netanyahu and criticizing the Israeli response to the attack. For some Democrats, Trump’s off-key response crystallized the contrast they want to present next year to voters: “Biden is quiet competence and Trump is chaos and it’s a real choice,” said Jenifer Fernandez Ancona, vice president and chief strategy officer at Way to Win, a liberal group that funds organizations and campaigns focusing on voters of color.           Ancona said Biden’s performance since the Hamas attack points to the case Democrats should be preparing to make to voters in 2024. “He’s been a workhorse not a show pony, but that’s something we can talk about,” she said. “You can show a picture of a president working quietly behind the scenes, you can tell a story of how he has your best interests at heart. It is what it is: he’s, what, 80? You can’t get around that. But I do think he has shown he has the capacity and strength and tenacity to do this job. He’s been doing it. So why shouldn’t he get a chance to keep doing it?”           Likewise, Rosenberg argues, “In my view you can’t separate his age from his successes as president. He’s been successful because of his age and experience not in spite of it, and we have to rethink that completely.”           Other Democrats, though, aren’t sure that Biden can neutralize concerns about his age by making a case for the benefits of his experience. One Democratic pollster familiar with thinking in the Biden campaign, who asked for anonymity while discussing the 2024 landscape, said that highlighting Biden’s experience would only produce limited value for him so long as most voters are dissatisfied with conditions in the country. “The problem with the experience side is that people feel bad,” the pollster said. “If people felt like his accomplishments improved things for them, they wouldn’t care about his age. … The problem with the age vs. experience [argument] is that experience has to produce results for them, but experience isn’t producing results.”           William Galston, a senior fellow at the Brookings Institution and long-time Democratic strategist, sees another limit to the experience argument. Like most Democrats, Galston believes that Biden’s response to the crisis has, in fact, demonstrated the value of his long track record on international issues. “This is where all of his instincts, honed by decades of experience, come into play,” Galston said. “He knows which people to call when; he knows whom to send where. As was the case in [Ukraine], this is the sort of episode where Biden is at his best.”           The problem, Galston argues, is that voters can see the value of Biden’s experience in dealing with world events today and still worry he could not effectively handle the presidency for another term. “It’s not a logical contradiction,” Galston said, for voters to believe that “‘Yes, over the first four years of his presidency, his experience proved its value, and he had enough energy and focus to be able to draw on it when he needed it’ and at the same time say, ‘I am very worried that over the next four years, in the tension between the advantages of experience and disadvantages of age, that balance is going to shift against him.’”           To assuage concerns about his capacity, Biden will need not only to “tell” voters about the value of his experience but to “show” them his vigor through a rigorous campaign schedule, Galston said. “The experience argument is necessary, but not sufficient,” Galston maintains. “In addition to that argument, assuming it can be made well and convincingly, I think he is going to have to show through his conduct of the campaign that he’s up for another four years.”           Biden’s trips into active war zones in Ukraine and Israel have provided dramatic images that his campaign is already using to make that case. As Galston suggests, the president will surely need to prove the point again repeatedly in 2024.           But most analysts agree that what the president most needs to demonstrate in the months ahead is not energy, but results. His supporters have reason for optimism that Biden’s carefully calibrated response to the Israel-Hamas hostilities will allow them to present him as a reassuring source of stability in an unstable world – in stark contrast to the unpredictability and chaos that Trump, his most likely 2024 opponent, perpetually generates. But Biden’s management of this volatile conflict will help him make that argument only if its outcome, in fact, promotes greater stability in the Middle East. If nothing else, Biden’s long experience has surely taught him how difficult stability will be to achieve in a region once again teetering on the edge of explosion.    © 2023 Cable News Network.

business,John Moore/Getty Images,https://edition.cnn.com/2023/11/09/business/school-milk-carton-shortage/index.html,"Markets     Fear & Greed Index                  Latest Market News            Julia Galliker learned out of the blue that there was a problem with milk carton supplies.           The milk that goes in the cartons was perfectly fine. The problem is with the packaging its sold in: Namely, there’s suddenly not enough of it. For Galliker, executive vice president of the Pennsylvania-based Galliker Dairy Company, that’s a big problem.           The Pennsylvania-based company, which sells milk along with other dairy products and beverages like juice and iced tea, processes 1.3 million small milk cartons each week, Galliker said. The little milk cartons go not only to schools, but to other institutions like nursing homes and correctional facilities. It has about 500 institutional customers buying these items.           The news from her supplier, which she did not name, left Galliker in a bind. “We had no indication that this was coming,” she said, adding that she’s been told to expect the problem to persist through the end of the year. “There’s not a lot of clarity,” she said. “It’s really day by day.”           Galliker isn’t the only one struggling. There are just a few US-based suppliers of these types of cartons, so milk processors have little recourse when things go awry. The carton shortage has been affecting these processors, and schools in turn, across the country in recent weeks. Everyone is scrambling to figure out a workaround. Galliker has set up a School Milk Hotline to try to help customers left without their typical supply.           The Department of Agriculture sounded the alarm in late October, laying out the situation in a memo posted to its website.           “USDA’s Food and Nutrition Service (FNS) is aware that schools in multiple states are experiencing milk supply chain challenges related to packaging issues,” the Department of Agriculture said on October 25.          The memo didn’t offer much more information about the nature of the issues.     ‘Toddler milk’ has no nutritional benefits, American Academy of Pediatrics reports         In a statement posted to its website, Cream-O-Land, which sells milk to schools, said that “Pactiv Evergreen, which supplies cartons to Cream-O-Land Dairies and other milk processing companies across the United States, is experiencing major production issues. These production issues have depleted most of our half pint (8 oz) and 4 oz carton supply.” The company added that “Pactiv Evergreen has notified us that it will supply less than 50% of our weekly needs of cartons to meet customer demand in the eastern United States,” and said it let the USDA and the Food and Drug Administration know about the problem in late September. “Starting immediately and continuing over the next few months, you may not receive the milk that was requested on your order,” Cream-O-Land added.           Pactiv Evergreen, which makes fresh beverage cartons, told CNN in a statement that it had miscalculated demand, without offering more details on what went wrong.           “Like other milk carton producers across the industry, Pactiv Evergreen continues to face significantly higher than projected demand,” a company spokesperson said in a statement. “We have and will continue to take actions to improve operational efficiencies to maximize near-term production and meet the increased demand.”           The disruption doesn’t mean there’s not enough milk to go around. But it does introduce distribution problems.           Early in the Covid-19 pandemic, when many restaurants and schools closed their doors, there was a massive mismatch between where milk was wanted and how it was packaged. Dairy farmers struggled to immediately shift to supplying supermarkets instead of foodservice providers, and as a result many had to dump out their milk supplies.           Industry experts aren’t expecting the same situation here, even though the shortage is upending certain operations.           Typically, milk sold to institutions like schools makes up about 7% to 7.5% of all fluid milk sold in the US for drinking — as opposed to condensed milk or milk used for ingredients in dairy products — said Matt Herrick, senior vice president of public affairs and communications at the International Dairy Foods Association, which represents dairy processors. “It is an important source,” of milk sales, he said.           “However, we don’t have the same concerns here,” as the industry did early in the pandemic, when “the bottom fell out of major markets overnight,” he said.           But “this is another situation where schools need to think on their feet and react quickly,” he said.           Generally, the Department of Agriculture requires public schools to offer fat free, 1% or flavored milk at breakfast and lunch. But because of the disruption, the USDA has relaxed some of these requirements, it noted in the October memo.           According to the USDA, schools in states with shortages can serve other types of milk or no milk at all. “Program operators are expected to meet the fluid milk requirements to the greatest extent possible,” but “supply chain disruptions, including disruptions that limit milk variety or affect serving size, would be considered a temporary emergency condition for purposes of this flexibility.”     The world’s best ice cream         At the Springville-Griffith Institute Central School District in Springville, New York, the cafeteria is planning to serve milk and chocolate milk in four- and eight-ounce cups, along with juice and water options.           In Everett, Washington, public schools warned that the disruption could last several months.           “Unfortunately, we cannot avoid the reality that our school district will run out of half-pint cartons of milk to serve,” the public school system said in a November 2 statement posted to its website. “We are actively working with our other suppliers to develop a plan that minimizes the impact on our students.” That includes transitioning to shelf-stable milk at breakfast. At lunch, juice and eight-ounce bottles of water will be offered as alternatives.           To offer an alternative solution to customers, Galliker has been switching to bulk packaging that can be poured or dispensed. But that option places an extra burden on school staff. “There’s always the manpower issue, [and] spillage, so it’s not a preferred option, but it is an alternative,” Galliker said.           In its statement, Cream-O-Land said it has been trying to find other sources of cartons, without much success. The company has been “attempting to purchase cartons from Tetra Pak,” which it described as “the only other carton supplier in the United States.” It added that “unfortunately, Tetra Pak informed us that it is no longer accepting new customers due to the increase in demand from their existing customers.” Cream-O-Land said it is looking for suppliers outside the US but that it may take some time to get those sellers approved.           Tetra Pak’s own carton supply has been fine. “We continue to meet our contracted order commitments with existing customers,” Seth Teply, president and CEO of Tetra Pak US and Canada, said in statement sent to CNN. “Our priority is to first fulfill contracted commitments before taking on additional orders, which we hope to do soon,” he added.           In an effort to help bridge the gap for other customers, the company has “increased overtime in our factory to ramp up production,” he said, noting that at this time it doesn’t have enough capacity to make up for the shortage in the market.           To help ease the burden on schools — and dissuade them from turning to non-milk alternatives — the American Dairy Association North East issued tips to dairy suppliers, suggesting that they offer to help pour milk themselves, donate cups or spearhead a cup donation drive, among other solutions.           In theory, Galliker could switch to plastic containers.           But “small unit plastic fillers don’t work quite as fast,” she said. Plus, because of the carton shortages, demand for plastic is increasing, she said, making those packages harder to find as well.           And really, nothing beats the carton. “It’s an inexpensive form of packaging. It’s a convenient form of packaging,” she said. “So there’s really not been any replacement for school milk cartons.”    Most stock quote data provided by BATS.

business,OpenAI says ChatGPT outages may be caused by targeted attack,https://edition.cnn.com/2023/11/09/business/chatgpt-outage-targeted-attack/index.html,"Markets     Fear & Greed Index                  Latest Market News            OpenAI said recent outages of its viral ChatGPT chatbot could be caused by targeted attacks on its servers.           The company wrote on its website Wednesday evening it is “dealing with periodic outages due to an abnormal traffic pattern reflective of a DDoS attack.”           A DDoS attack, or distributed denial of service,  typically refers to an attacker that floods an internet server to disrupt normal traffic.           “We are continuing work to mitigate this,” OpenAI said.           Users on Wednesday were unable to access all of OpenAI’s tools and services and received a message that the platform was at capacity.           The company told CNN no user information was compromised.           The outage comes three days after OpenAI hosted its first developer conference, held in San Francisco. It was held nearly a year after the launch of ChatGPT, which helped renew an arms race among tech companies to develop and deploy similar AI tools in their products.     CEO Sam Altman said 2 million developers now use the platform, and about 90% of Fortune 500 companies are using the tools internally. It currently has 100 million active users.           At the event, the company unveiled a series of artificial intelligence tool updates, including the ability for developers to create custom versions of ChatGPT.

business,Vice to end several news shows and lay off dozens of staffers in hollowing out of news division,https://edition.cnn.com/2023/11/09/media/vice-end-news-shows-layoffs/index.html,"Markets     Fear & Greed Index                  Latest Market News            Vice Media, the one-time digital media darling that has seen its value and influence greatly diminish in recent years, moved on Thursday to further hollow out its once prestigious news division, shutting down several shows and laying off dozens of staffers.           “To be clear, Vice News is not going away,” the company’s co-chief executives, Bruce Dixon and Hozefa Lokhandwala, said in a memo to staff obtained by CNN. “Vice will continue to produce digital news, as well as Vice News documentaries, both series and films, for FAST Channels, streaming services and other partners.”           In April, Vice Media ended “Vice News Tonight,” its flagship program, citing restructuring that would result in cuts across the organization, CNN previously reported. In May, Vice filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy ahead of a planned sale. In June, the digital media company was purchased by three investment companies, including Fortress Investment Group, for $350 million.           It was not immediately known which shows would be shut down, but Dixon and Lokhandwala said they had reached the end of their production cycle and had not been renewed by their distributors, adding that “certain roles” from the shows would be affected. A person familiar with the matter said “less than 100” staffers would be laid off.           The Vice union responded to the layoffs in a statement via X, formerly known as Twitter, on Thursday, accusing management of “contempt” for its workers and handling the actual layoff announcements in “sloppy fashion.”    Our statement regarding today's layoffs at VICE pic.twitter.com/CJTtiYXJML        A former senior Vice employee, who spoke on the condition of anonymity, described the cuts in brutal terms to CNN, saying that the notion the company is still committed to news is “not true” and that “it’s all a facade.”           The chief executives also said they would take the current moment to “restructure our overall corporate organization” by consolidating the newsroom’s five pillars into two lines of business — with publishing, news, and creative services under one line and studios along with TV and distribution under the other.           The company will also continue its market review, which could result in closures in different countries or markets, Dixon and Lokhandwala said, describing the decision as “an imperative in the current market environment and for the long-term health of the Company.”     CNN’s Oliver Darcy contributed to this report.    Most stock quote data provided by BATS.

business,A top LGBTQ+ advocacy org is quitting X over safety concerns,https://edition.cnn.com/2023/11/09/tech/trevor-project-quitting-x-safety-concerns/index.html,"Markets     Fear & Greed Index                  Latest Market News            The Trevor Project, a suicide prevention organization for LGBTQ+ youth, is quitting social media site X, saying Thursday it is concerned about “increasing hate & vitriol on the platform targeting the LGBTQ community — the group we exist to serve.”           “If you’d like to keep up with our work supporting LGBTQ young people, we invite you to follow us on Instagram, TikTok, LinkedIn, and Facebook,” or on TrevorSpace.org, the group said in a statement about closing its account on the platform formerly known as Twitter. “No online space is perfect, but having access to sufficient moderation capabilities is essential to maintaining a safer space for our community.”           The move to leave X comes after months of concerns about hateful speech on the platform, as owner Elon Musk emphasizes his desire for what he calls “free speech” instead. Musk has also taken hits at digital online watchdog groups who criticized the company’s handling of hate speech and other troubling content, including suing the Center for Countering Digital Hate and threatening legal action against the Anti-Defamation League (the lawsuit against the ADL never materialized, and the group later resumed advertising on X).     X in April also rolled back a portion of its hateful conduct policy that included specific protections for transgender people, including removing a prohibition against “targeted misgendering or deadnaming of transgender individuals.”     Twitter removes transgender protections from hateful conduct policy         Musk himself — whose daughter is transgender and said earlier this year that she wanted to cut ties with her father — has been criticized for some of his statements on X regarding gender identity issues.           For example, in December 2020 he made a post, since deleted, that said “when you put he/him in your bio” alongside a drawing of an 18th century soldier rubbing blood on his face in front of a pile of dead bodies and wearing a cap that read “I love to oppress.” (In response to criticism to that post, Musk wrote on the platform: “I absolutely support trans, but all these pronouns are an esthetic nightmare.”)           The Trevor Project also noted that its exit from X comes after hundreds of anti-LGBTQ+ bills, a record number, have been introduced into statehouses across the United States in 2023. Fellow civil rights organization the Human Rights Campaign in June declared a “state of emergency” for members of the LGBTQ+ community.           “We have seen this rhetoric transcend politics and appear on social media platforms,” a representative for the Trevor Project told CNN. “The content we share on social media is intended to uplift and affirm LGBTQ young people, shedding light on stories to deepen the public understanding of their experiences. In response to mental health resources and messages of hope and support, we’ve seen anti-LGBTQ rhetoric and commentary on our posts that can negatively impact LGBTQ young people.”           Indeed, many of the replies to the group’s recent posts on X are filled with dozens of angry and hateful comments, in some cases hidden behind a label that notes they may be offensive.           A year after Musk acquired the platform, X has been scrambling to stem the tide of users leaving the platform for alternatives in the wake of the billionaire’s controversial leadership style and policy changes. A number of new social platforms have cropped up over the past year, including Meta’s Threads, Mastodon, a new site backed by Twitter founder Jack Dorsey called Bluesky and a platform from former Twitter employees called Spill.           The company has also been attempting to convince many advertisers to resume or increase their spending on the platform despite concerns that ads could show up alongside hateful content or misinformation. X CEO Linda Yaccarino has touted the platform’s brand safety controls that are meant to allow advertisers to choose what kinds of content their ads can appear next to.           CNN has reached out to X about the Trevor Project deleting its account.    Most stock quote data provided by BATS.

business,"Jezebel shuts down, lays off staff in ‘excruciating’ decision, parent company says",https://edition.cnn.com/2023/11/09/media/jezebel-go-media-spanfeller-suspend-publication/index.html,"Markets     Fear & Greed Index                  Latest Market News            Jezebel, the punchy feminist blog with an outsized influence on internet culture, will suspend operations and lay off its staff effective immediately, its parent company G/O Media said Thursday as it announced broader restructuring in its portfolio of digital news outlets.           Jim Spanfeller, chief executive of G/O Media, said in a memo to staff obtained by CNN that the company had tried to sell the publication, but that after talks with two dozen potential buyers, “we could not find Jez a new home.”           “As of this week we are making the very, very difficult decision to suspend publication of Jezebel,” Spanfeller said. “Few decisions over the course of my career have been as excruciating, and I want to make clear this is in NO WAY a reflection on the Jezebel editorial team.”           Spanfeller said he has not “given up” on finding a buyer for Jezebel, which he described as having a “storied legacy as the website that changed women’s media forever.”           Spanfeller additionally announced Thursday that G/O would undergo broader restructuring that will result in layoffs.           “We have been operating over the last few quarters with an eye towards efficiency and being budget conscious. I had been hoping that by doing so we could see our way through these dark times in our industry,” he told employees in his memo. “And indeed, we held out far longer than most. But we can hold out no longer.”           In total, the suspension of Jezebel’s operations and other restructuring actions will “result in the departure of 23 editorial staffers,” Spanfeller said.           The cuts come as the broader media industry continues to struggle with a weak advertising climate. Vice also announced cuts to its news team on Thursday. And across the media landscape, cost cutting and layoffs have been rampant over the past year.           “Just about every company in our space has found themselves in similar circumstances,” Spanfeller said.

business,Mortgage rates plunge by largest amount in a year,https://edition.cnn.com/2023/11/09/homes/mortgage-rates-november-9/index.html,"Markets     Fear & Greed Index                  Latest Market News            Mortgage rates tumbled this week in the biggest one-week drop since last November. It’s the second straight week that rates have fallen, after rising for seven consecutive weeks.           The 30-year fixed-rate mortgage fell to an average of 7.50% in the week ending November 9, down from 7.76% the week before, according to data from Freddie Mac released Thursday.           A year ago, the average 30-year fixed-rate reached 7.08%, its highest level in 2022. The following week, rates dropped by 47 basis points. This week saw a drop of 26 basis points from last week.           “As Treasury yields decline, the 30-year fixed-rate mortgage dropped a quarter of a percent, the largest one-week decrease since last November,” said Sam Khater, Freddie Mac’s chief economist.     This is the least affordable housing market since 1984. It’s getting worse         “Incoming data show that household debt continues to rise, primarily due to mortgage, credit card and student loan balances,” he said. “Many consumers are feeling strained by the high cost of living, so unless mortgage rates decrease significantly, the housing market will remain stagnant.”           The average mortgage rate is based on mortgage applications that Freddie Mac receives from thousands of lenders across the country. The survey includes only borrowers who put 20% down and have excellent credit. A current buyer’s rate may be different.           Homebuyers have been shellshocked by surging rates, which have sent home loan applications and home sales down sharply. Sales hit a 13-year low in September as buyers paused their home search, waiting for more inventory and lower mortgage rates.           But as mortgage rates dipped last week, there was a 2.5% increase in all applications for loans from a week ago, according to the Mortgage Bankers Association. Applications for a mortgage to purchase a home went up by 3%.           “Applications for both purchase and refinance loans were up over the week but remained at low levels,” said Joel Kan, MBA’s vice president and deputy chief economist. “The purchase index is still more than 20% behind last year’s pace, as many homebuyers remain on the sidelines until more for-sale inventory becomes available.”           The Federal Reserve’s decision at last week’s monetary policy meeting to keep interest rates where they were was good news for homebuyers struggling with sky-high mortgage rates, but the option for an additional Fed rate hike is still on the table.           “More economic indicators are needed to determine whether the current policy is ‘restrictive enough’ to bring inflation back to the [Fed’s] 2% target,” said Jiayi Xu, an economist at Realtor.com.     The Fed holds interest rates steady for second time         While the Fed does not set the interest rates that borrowers pay on mortgages directly, its actions influence them. Mortgage rates tend to track the yield on 10-year US Treasuries, which move based on a combination of anticipation about the Fed’s actions, what the Fed actually ends up doing and investors’ reactions. When Treasury yields go up, so do mortgage rates; when they go down, mortgage rates tend to follow.           Meanwhile, Xu said, the October jobs report, which revealed moderate job growth and reduced wage pressures, might boost confidence among policymakers that the economy will continue to ease without the need for more Fed rate hikes in the coming months. The Fed’s last rate-setting meeting of the year is scheduled for December 12-13.           “As the possibility of a rate hike remains on the table, investors are likely to exercise caution in their positioning, and the expectations for [mortgage] rates to stay steady to slightly higher remains,” said Xu.           Homebuyers are getting a little break in rates just as unaffordability reaches new heights.         While the median price of a home in October was about the same as last year, according to Realtor.com, mortgage rates that have been over 7% since mid-August have resulted in a significant increase in the cost of financing a typical home purchase.           The monthly cost to buy a home has risen by over $166. That’s a 7.4% increase compared to the previous year and a new record in the year-over-year increase in the cost of buying a home, Realtor.com has found.           But while mortgage rates remain relatively high, the difference between rates now and what they were a year ago has narrowed, said Lisa Sturtevant, chief economist at Bright Multiple Listing Service.           “In many ways, market conditions are similar to what they were last November,” she said. “The difference is that consumers have adjusted their expectations about mortgage rates.”           “Many buyers are pressing on and will act quickly when they see rates dip,” she said. “Other prospective homebuyers will bide their time until after the first of the year, hoping for lower rates and more inventory.”           While rates are expected to come down in 2024, she said, they are not forecast to return to pandemic levels.           “We are in a new era for mortgage rates, where prospective homebuyers can expect rates to settle above 6%,” said Sturtevant.

business,Another labor deal averts strike at eight more Vegas casinos,https://edition.cnn.com/2023/11/09/business/mgm-casinos-labor-deal/index.html,"Markets     Fear & Greed Index                  Latest Market News            The Culinary union has reached a deal with MGM Resorts International covering 25,400 members, averting a strike at eight casinos that had been set to start Friday.           The deal, announced in a tweet by the union, comes a day after a similar deal was reached with Caesars Entertainment that averted a strike by 10,000 other union members at nine casinos operated by that company.           Both those tentative agreements need to be ratified by rank-and-file members before they can take effect and end the risk of a strike altogether. Negotiations are due to take place Thursday at the remaining company facing a Friday strike, Wynn Resorts, but the threat of the largest hospitality strike in US history has largely ended. The threatened strike would have been due to start at 5 AM local time Friday.           A strike at almost all of the city’s major casinos would have come at a particularly bad time. The city is hosting an F1 Grand Prix that will include a portion of the Strip as a racetrack. Practice runs are scheduled for Thursday and Friday next week, and the race itself is set for Saturday, November 18. There are also concerts and other events scheduled, and by some estimates the weekend is expected to draw about 100,000 visitors to the city. Overall, the city has about 150,000 hotel rooms, according to the Las Vegas Convention and Visitors Authority.           The terms of the deal were not immediately available, but it likely matches the significant immediate raises the union said that it won Wednesday at Caesars, equalling nearly $4.57 an hour in additional money going immediately to a combination of pay and benefits. It said there will be additional raises over the five-year life of the contract.           The likelihood of a deal was signaled Wednesday in the wake of the deal at Caesars. MGM CEO William Hornbuckle told analysts during a conference call Wednesday afternoon that he believed a strike would be averted there as well, saying that he thought a deal would be reached Wednesday.           “We’re pleased to have reached a tentative agreement that averts a strike, gives our Culinary union employees a well-earned boost to pay and benefits and reduces workloads – all while continuing to provide opportunities for growth and advancement,” Hornbuckle said in a joint statement issued early Thursday with the union.           MGM’s eight Las Vegas casinos - the Aria, Bellagio, Excalibur, Luxor, Mandalay Bay, MGM Grand, New York-New York and Park MGM - brought in $6.4 billion in revenue in the first nine months of this year, or more than half of the company’s overall revenue. They produced operating income of $2.3 billion. Both figures are slightly higher than a year earlier, even after MGM sold its Mirage casino in December of 2022.           Ted Pappageorge, the union’s secretary-treasurer and chief negotiator, said Wednesday that the union was ready to strike at MGM if it didn’t match the deal reached earlier that day with Caesars. He praised the MGM deal Thursday, although he would not give details.           “We are proud to say that this is the best contract and economic package we have ever won … in our 88-year history,” said Pappageorge in the joint statement issued with MGM. “Workers have secured significant raises every year for the next five years, preserved our great union health insurance, union pension, and comprehensive union benefits, while gaining historic improvements in housekeeping workload reductions.”           He said workers in Vegas are still suffering from rising prices, especially in rents. Many workers at the casinos work multiple jobs. One of the union’s main bargaining slogans is “one job should be enough.”           In Las Vegas, typical rents spiked nearly 40% from prior to the pandemic, according to Zillow. Typical rent reached a high of $1,861 a month in July of 2022, which was up 38% from $1,351 a month in July 2019. Since that peak, rents in Las Vegas have come down slightly, following national trends, and the typical rent in the city was $1,808 in September of this year. But that’s still 33% higher than rent in September 2019.           “With this new union contract, hospitality workers will be able to provide for their families and thrive in Las Vegas,” said Pappageorge.           The average Culinary union member in Las Vegas gets $26 an hour in both pay and benefits, but the union would not break out how much of that goes to salary and how much goes to benefits such as no-premium health care and a traditional pension plan that pays a monthly benefit to retirees.           Unions have been flexing their muscles this year, taking the number of workers on strike to levels not seen in decades. There have been 348 strikes so far this year, up 56% from the same period of 2021, according to a strike tracker kept by Cornell University’s school of industrial and labor relations.           US unions have been winning some large gains in recent negotiations, sometimes with a strike, sometimes without.           Most recently SAG-AFTRA, which represents 160,000 actors, had been on strike for nearly four months against major studios and streaming services before reaching its own tentative deal Wednesday evening. Terms of that deal were not dislosed, but union President Fran Drescher described it in an Instagram post as a “Billion+ $ Deal! 3X the last contract!”           That deal came in the wake of the United Auto Workers union reaching deals with General Motors, Ford and Stellantis that included guaranteed wages of 25% over life of contract that runs through April of 2028, and a cost-of-living adjustments that could take the pay of most workers up more than 30% when combined with the guaranteed wages.           A coalition of unions at Kaiser Permanente won raises totaling 21% over the four-year deal reached after 75,000 union members there waged the largest health care strike in US history.           And the Teamsters union reached a deal with UPS in July that averted an August 1 strike by more than 340,000 members, which included a minimum of $7.50 in hourly wage hikes during the life of the contract, and raised the pay of a delivery driver there 18%, to $49 an hour. It also eliminated a lower tier of pay for many union members and gave bigger pay hikes to some part-time workers.           But some unions have yet to be able to reach deals on new contracts, including 3,700 members of a coalition of unions — which includes the Teamsters and the UAW — who have been striking three Detroit casinos since October 17. One of those casinos is owned by MGM.           And about 15,000 union members have been waging a series of set-duration on-and-off strikes against 65 hotels in Los Angeles and Orange counties in California since July 4.

business,"Actors’ union reaches tentative deal with Hollywood film and TV studios, ending historic strike",https://edition.cnn.com/2023/11/08/media/sag-aftra-actors-strike-over/index.html,"Markets     Fear & Greed Index                  Latest Market News            Hollywood actors have reached a tentative agreement with the major film and television studios to end their historic strike, the actors union announced Wednesday. The strike had shut down production across the industry for nearly four months and raised existential questions over the future of the entertainment business.           The Alliance of Motion Picture and Television Producers, which represents the studios, had been negotiating with the union off and on throughout the year to reach a deal. Both the AMPTP and the actors praised the deal.           Union president Fran Drescher called the agreement “historic,” and the studios said the agreement “represents a new paradigm” for Hollywood, TV and the actors.           “We did it!!!! The Billion+ $ Deal! 3X the last contract! New ground was broke everywhere! Ty sag aftra members for hanging in and holding out for this historic deal!” Drescher posted on Instagram Wednesday.           The strike will officially end at midnight, the union said in a statement, concluding one of the longest and most disruptive strikes in Hollywood’s history that brought the industry to a standstill.           “The AMPTP is pleased to have reached a tentative agreement and looks forward to the industry resuming the work of telling great stories,” the studios said in a statement.           The White House applauded the agreement, saying in a statement it shows that “collective bargaining works.”           Terms of the deal, which still needs to be ratified by the union’s members before it can take effect, were not immediately disclosed. The union said it would not reveal them until the union’s board has reviewed the deal.           But in a statement to members, the union called the scope of the billion-dollar deal “extraordinary,” noting it includes significant increases in pay minimums, AI protections, and a streaming participation bonus, along with better benefits.           “We have arrived at a contract that will enable SAG-AFTRA members from every category to build sustainable careers,” the union told members.           In an interview with CNN’s Kate Bolduan, Drescher said the contract “broke so much ground.” One of the major sticking points in negotiations was added protections for actors’ digital likenesses that could be used with AI, which Drescher said was added in “very late in the evening the night before we passed.”           “There was nothing in the contract that was consent, they didn’t have to ask for permission for anything,” Drescher said of the previous contract language. “Now, they have to ask for permission for everything.”           The union’s lowest-paid members also “got an unbelievable deal,” Drescher said.           The studios said in their statement that the actors will get “the biggest contract-on-contract gains in the history of the union, including the largest increase in minimum wages in the last forty years; a brand new residual for streaming programs; extensive consent and compensation protections in the use of artificial intelligence; and sizable contract increases on items across the board.”           Drescher thanked the AMPTP “for hearing us and meeting this moment.”           The actors represented by SAG-AFTRA are to return to work after they walked off the set on July 14, joining the writers’ guild in a historic double strike against the studios – the first time the writers and actors had simultaneously been on strike in more than 60 years.           While the writers’ strike was resolved in September, production has remained shuttered as the actors continued to strike and negotiate their contract. At the center of both standoffs is the rise of artificial intelligence, which threatens to upend the entire entertainment business.           The deal could face challenges getting ratified. An online petition signed by more than 5,000 members recently urged the union to take a hard line in negotiations toward a final deal, saying they would not agree to a deal that did not meet the demands laid out at the start of the strike.           “We have not come all this way to cave now,” said the letter. “We have not gone without work, without pay, and walked picket lines for months just to give up on everything we’ve been fighting for. We cannot and will not accept a contract that fails to address the vital and existential problems that we all need fixed.”           The tentative agreement with the AMPTP, once accepted by SAG leadership, will next go to the union’s board. The board has until Friday morning to approve it, Drescher said, at which point SAG’s roughly 160,000-member body will vote on whether to ratify it.           The relationship between SAG and the AMPTP should be “business as usual and zero problem” looking forward, Drescher said on CNN.           A deal did not come easily – or quickly.           After several fits and starts, the striking actors had resumed negotiations on October 2 with producers after a long time away from the bargaining table. The announcement to restart talks came a day after leaders of the Writers Guild of America voted to authorize its members to return to work following their tentative agreement reached September 24 between union negotiators and Hollywood’s studios and streaming services.           But the actors’ contract negotiations didn’t last long, breaking down on Oct. 11 before returning later in the month.           By the end of October, it appeared the actors’ strike was approaching its final scene. SAG-AFTRA and AMPTP had made significant progress in negotiating sessions, arriving at tentative understandings on key components of a potential deal, CNN reported.           This past weekend, the studios said they delivered the union their “last, best & final offer.” But the union said in a message to its members that there are several “essential items” that the two sides have yet to reach agreement on, such as the use of AI.           Los Angeles Mayor Karen Bass on Wednesday said she welcomed the resolution to the strike.           “I am grateful that a fair agreement has been reached between SAG-AFTRA and AMPTP after a more than 100 day strike that impacted millions in Los Angeles and throughout the country,” Bass said. “Those on the line have been the hardest hit during this period and there have been ripple effects throughout our entire city.”           Hollywood’s most famous stars were eager to get back on set. George Clooney, Tyler Perry and other A-list actors offered to pay millions more in union dues to help end the actors’ strike, a source with knowledge of the proposal previously told CNN.           SAG-AFTRA’s deal follows on the heels of the Writers Guild agreement, whose strike ended after 148 days. The WGA deal ramped up pressure for SAG-AFTRA to reach an agreement along the same lines. SAG-AFTRA joined the picket line a little over two months after the Writers Guild went on strike.           Their contract, which will expire in May 2026, includes pay increases, better benefits, protections against the studios’ use of artificial intelligence, guarantees for streaming compensation, longer-duration employment terms and other perks.           “We’re thrilled to see SAG-AFTRA members win a contract that creates new protections for performers and gives them a greater share of the immense value they create,” the WGA said in a statement Wednesday.     SAG-AFTRA’s demands were similar to WGA’s, particularly regarding artificial intelligence and residuals payments from streaming services for their work. WGA’s ratified contract included assurances that AI cannot write or rewrite literary material and will require AI-generated materials to be disclosed to writers. Both actors and writers alike believe AI poses an existential threat to their livelihoods.           A major sticking point during negotiations was SAG-AFTRA’s demands for an 11% wage increase in the first year of the proposed contract term, while the studios had only agreed to a 5% pay raise.           Work for many writers resumed promptly. Late night’s biggest hosts – Jimmy Kimmel, Jimmy Fallon, Stephen Colbert, John Oliver and Seth Meyers – returned to the air quickly after the writers strike ended. But Hollywood actors have not appeared on their shows to promote their movies during the actors strike.           The Hollywood strikes have been costly, with a nationwide economic impact of at least $5 billion, according to economists. The impacts have gone beyond production; it’s affected local businesses and restaurants, as well as makeup artists and custodians.     – CNN’s Liam Reilly contributed to this report.

business,Apple’s fight against a $14 billion EU tax bill suffers a setback,https://edition.cnn.com/2023/11/09/tech/apple-eu-tax-bill-dispute/index.html,"Markets     Fear & Greed Index                  Latest Market News      Luxembourg — A European tribunal made legal errors when it ruled in favor of Apple over a €13 billion ($14 billion) tax order and should review the case again, an adviser to Europe’s top court said Thursday, in a potential setback for the iPhone maker.           The tax case against Apple (AAPL) dates back years and was part of a crackdown by the European Union’s antitrust chief Margrethe Vestager on deals between multinationals and EU countries that regulators saw as unfair state aid.           In a 2016 decision, the European Commission, the EU’s executive arm, said Apple had benefited from two Irish tax rulings for more than two decades that artificially reduced its tax burden to as low as 0.005% in 2014.           Apple challenged the ruling, and the EU’s General Court upheld the challenge in 2020, saying regulators had not met the legal standard to show Apple had enjoyed an unfair advantage.           But Advocate General Giovanni Pitruzzella at the European Court of Justice (ECJ) — the EU’s highest court — disagreed, saying judges should set aside the General Court ruling and refer the case back to the lower tribunal.           “The judgment of the General Court on ‘tax rulings’ adopted by Ireland in relation to Apple should be set aside,” he said in a non-binding opinion.           He said the General Court had committed a series of errors in law.           “It is therefore necessary for the General Court to carry out a new assessment,” Pitruzzella said.           The ECJ, which will rule in the coming months, follows around four in five such recommendations.           Ireland reiterated that it had not provided any state aid to Apple.           “It is important to bear in mind that this opinion does not form part of the Court of Justice of the European Union judgment but is considered by the Court when arriving at its final ruling,” Ireland’s finance minister Michael McGrath said in a statement. “It has always been, and remains, Ireland’s position that the correct amount of Irish tax was paid and that Ireland provided no state aid to Apple.”           Although Apple and Dublin appealed against the tax order, Apple nevertheless had to hand over the full amount, which Ireland has been holding in an escrow account.           “We thank the court for its time and ongoing consideration in this case. The General Court’s ruling was very clear that Apple received no selective advantage and no state aid, and we believe that should be upheld,” an Apple spokesperson said.           Vestager has a mixed record defending her tax cases in court, with judges backing challenges by automaker Stellantis, Amazon and Starbucks.           Her biggest legal victory to date came in September when the General Court upheld her decision against a €700 million ($749 million) Belgian tax scheme for 55 multinationals. Her tax crackdown has forced EU countries to scrap such sweetheart deals.    Most stock quote data provided by BATS.

business,Janet Yellen to host China’s top economic official ahead of expected Biden-Xi talks in San Francisco,https://edition.cnn.com/2023/11/09/economy/janet-yellen-he-lifeng-biden-xi-china-hnk-intl/index.html,"Markets     Fear & Greed Index                  Latest Market News        Editor’s Note: Sign up for CNN’s Meanwhile in China newsletter which explores what you need to know about the country’s rise and how it impacts the world.         US Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen will meet Chinese Vice Premier He Lifeng to discuss the bilateral relationship between the world’s two largest economies and other global issues over two days starting Thursday.           Yellen’s talks with China’s new economic tsar will set the stage for the high-stakes potential meeting expected between US President Joe Biden and Chinese President Xi Jinping next week during the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation forum in San Francisco. The United States is the host for this year’s summit, which is an annual gathering of top leaders in government and business of the 21 economies in the Pacific Rim.           US-China relations have improved in recent months after tensions between the two countries flared early in the year. US and Chinese officials are seeking to shore up diplomatic ties and cooperation on economic issues. That’s on the backdrop of a sputtering global economy and ongoing geopolitical strain in other parts of the world.           Yellen last saw He in Beijing in July — the second visit by a US cabinet official to the Chinese capital in a matter of weeks as Washington sought to steer relations back on course.           In total, Washington has sent four cabinet officials to Beijing since the summer, including Secretary of State Antony Blinken, climate envoy John Kerry and Commerce Secretary Gina Raimondo.           Beijing has also sent its top diplomat, Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi, to the US capital.           The flurry of diplomatic activity appears to have helped stabilized ties between the two sides, which had been at odds over a range of issues including constraints on US investments in advanced technology in China and newly expanded curbs on the kinds of semiconductors that American firms are able to sell there.     Blinken meets with China’s top diplomat as specter of war in Middle East looms         “Neither Biden nor Xi wants things to deteriorate any further and I think both sides recognize that in this challenging and volatile moment globally, having better stability in US-China relations benefits both nations and the world,” said Mattie Bekink, the Shanghai-based China director of the Economist Intelligence Corporate Network.           “This does not mean that tensions are over,” she added. “To the contrary, there seems to be more candor about where and why challenges remain while seeking alignment or at least a framework for engagement where possible — trade and investment, climate change.”           Earlier this year, Yellen outlined three principles guiding the US relationship with China: prioritizing national security and defending human rights, promoting a healthy and fair economic relationship with China and cooperating with China to address global issues.           Yellen last week at an event in Washington said, “the United States does not seek to decouple from China,” but said that the United States is trying to “ensure that our country’s economic security is not reliant on just one country for many critical inputs.” That country is China, she said.           “We know that the US-China relationship is among the most consequential in the world and we need to get it right for Americans and for people around the world,” Yellen said. “The separation of our economies, or an approach in which countries, including those in the Indo-Pacific, are forced to take sides, would have significant negative global repercussions. We have no interest in such a divided world and its disastrous effects.”           US officials are trying to delicately mend the nation’s relationship with China by remaining steadfast on national security and human rights, but not giving the impression that it is trying to actively undermine China’s economic future.     Beijing is ready to improve ties with US, says Chinese vice-president         The Treasury Department is in charge of turning the Biden administration’s August executive order — which limits US investment in China’s artificial intelligence, quantum computing and semiconductor industries — into guidelines expected to take effect next year.           US officials have said the restrictions were intended to prevent US capital from aiding China’s military — not to hurt China’s economy. But American investors have told CNN that the rules were seen as a “major blow” to the US venture capital industry.           Meanwhile, China has been trying to pull itself out of a deep economic slump marked by high youth unemployment and a sluggish real estate market through stimulus measures. The International Monetary Fund recently upgraded its forecast for China’s economic growth based on Beijing’s policies aimed at propping up the country’s ailing property sector.

business,Ohio just legalized cannabis. Now comes the hard part,https://edition.cnn.com/2023/11/09/business/ohio-legal-cannabis-industry/index.html,"Markets     Fear & Greed Index                  Latest Market News            Ohio certainly wasn’t the first state to legalize recreational cannabis — 23 other states have done so since 2012 — but the Buckeye State’s arrival on that list could ultimately be quite consequential for the growing industry.     Ohio voters’ approval of a legalization measure on Tuesday comes just months after cannabis saw some of its most significant movements at the federal level. In late August, a US Department of Health and Human Services official recommended that marijuana be reclassified as a Schedule III drug. One month later, a cannabis banking bill passed a key Senate committee.           A conservative and politically influential state such as Ohio legalizing marijuana should be the straw that breaks the proverbial camel’s back in terms of bringing federal regulation to cannabis, said Andrew Freedman, a partner at Forbes Tate and executive director of the Coalition for Cannabis Policy, Education and Regulation. “As Ohio goes, so goes the nation,” he said.           “It’s not the reddest [state] — the reddest was Missouri — but it is historically important, nationally important, presidentially important,” Freedman told CNN. “I honestly think it will have massive reverberating effects on what Congress has to do about this.”     More than two-thirds of US states have legalized cannabis in some capacity: 38 states have approved comprehensive medical cannabis programs, and Ohio brings the recreational total to 24 states.           And support for legalization continues to grow. A record 70% of US adults surveyed by pollster Gallup said that cannabis use should be legal, according to a new poll released Wednesday.           Still, cannabis remains federally illegal, and marijuana is classified as a Schedule I substance, the harshest of all drug classifications.           “A ‘no’ vote does send a signal across the nation that this is a major, middle-of-the-road/leaning-right part of this country that is saying, ‘Not too fast,’ and yet it passed by an overwhelming margin,” Freedman said. “I do think that it is a very clear message to the federal government that prohibition is no longer the law of the land, even though it remains on the books.”           For Ohio regulators, legislators and business operators, now comes the hard part.           The voter-approved recreational measure approved this week is far afield from early legalization efforts in the state. In 2015, residents overwhelmingly voted against a medical and adult-use measure that would have limited growing and sales to 10 properties, all of which were owned by an investor group that included the 98 Degrees boy-bander Nick Lachey.           The law allows for adults over the age of 21 to buy and possess up to 2.5 ounces of cannabis and grow some plants at home for personal use. Legal sales will be subject to a 10% excise tax, as well as other local and state taxes, and those proceeds will go toward communities with dispensaries, programs such as small and minority business development, and addiction treatment.           Existing medical cannabis dispensaries will have the opportunity to be grandfathered in and have first crack at licenses, but municipalities can decide whether to allow sales.           Since it’s a citizen-initiated measure and not a constitutional amendment, it could be modified or repealed in the Republican-controlled state legislature. Some lawmakers and Republican Governor Mike DeWine have opposed legalization.           But Freedman said: “I think the legislature needs to be careful, because it passed with large amounts of support (57% of voters approved), and generally, you should respect the will of the voters. But if there are parts of the bill that would create a lack of accountability, then those should be shored up.”           “For the most part, I think that they should have the nuts and bolts of a system that can have good inventory control, take bad actors out of the market and make sure that sales will stay internal to Ohio,” he said.           Some legislators may try to “slow-walk” implementation or try to scuttle it; however, others who see it as a potential economic development boon may try to push it forward, said Douglas Berman, executive director of the Drug Enforcement and Policy Center at The Ohio State University’s Moritz College of Law.           “That’s the to-be-determined on implementation, and of course this has been the story state by state nationwide,” he said. “Every state has had its own uncertainty for rollout. And given the fact that Ohio’s the 24th state is likely to help this go a little bit smoother.”           If all goes smoothly, Ohio’s recreational program could get up and running relatively quickly.           The law goes into effect on December 7; state regulators have to issue licenses to existing medical cannabis applicants within nine months and additional licenses to other applicants within two years.           “I certainly think, perhaps to the chagrin of some longtime Buckeyes, that it would be fair to say this is kind of a Michigan model that Ohio has adopted through this initiative,” Berman said. “In 2018, Michigan fully legalized cannabis, set a relatively low tax rate and my perception is it’s been a fairly successful industry there.”           Michigan’s cannabis sales hit a record $276 million in July, a time when industry members there and beyond have struggled.           It’s “pretty universally held at this point in time that this industry is not doing well,” said Irina Dashevsky, partner and co-chair of the cannabis law practice group at Greenspoon Marder.           Companies are struggling because of the federal-state disconnect that’s resulted in cannabis firms facing extremely onerous tax burdens, the inability to conduct interstate commerce, and lack of access to the full financial system the United States has to offer, she said. Additionally, some states have seen the number of operators — regulated and illicit — swell, resulting in a glut of cannabis product and, thus, plunging prices.           Investors have recoiled, and companies have had to turn to debt-based funding, but that’s expensive because cannabis companies can’t avail themselves of traditional financial services and bank loans, she said.           The Secure and Fair Enforcement Regulation (SAFER) Banking Act, which passed a key Senate committee, could allow cannabis businesses greater access to banks — but it does not solve all the issues the industry faces, Dashevsky said.           “There is this confluence of things that really lead me to believe that change of the federal level is on the forefront, but we’ve been there before and it hasn’t crossed the finish line for weird, outside reasons,” she said. “It should be regulated; no one’s saying it should be a free-for-all, but the people in the US want it legalized, and so for the federal government not to catch up after a decade? I think it’s definitely time, and Ohio is a huge indicator of that.”           Adult-use sales in Ohio could total an estimated $1.5 billion to $2 billion in the first year after market-launch, and $3.5 billion to $4 billion by the fourth year, according to industry publication MJBizDaily.           In five years of operation, Ohio could see between $276 million and $403 million in annual tax revenue, according to Drug Enforcement and Policy Center research. That’s a drop in the bucket of the overall state budget, which for fiscal year 2023 stood at $81.1 billion.           Harvest of OH, which opened medical cannabis dispensaries in 2021, is one of the Ohio firms gearing up for a major expansion to respond to what could be an “onslaught” of recreational sales, said Ariane Kirkpatrick, founder and majority owner.           Harvest will have the opportunity to receive three additional licenses at the recreational level and has already received approval for the expansion of its cultivation footprint.           “It’s all sort of new, it’s all up in the air right now, but we’re pretty adaptable,” Kirkpatrick said, noting the company’s team, processes and logistics that are already in place.           Harvest of OH also has the potential to help drive the industry forward by making it more inclusive, said Amonica Davis, the company’s chief operating officer.           “In the state of Ohio, with dispensaries, cultivators and processors, there are already over 150 operators and just a handful of us are Black,” she said. “And so we have a commitment, and we are very intentional in creating our workforce that is very highly concentrated with women at the executive level, over 50% of our employees are people of color, and much of our supply chain comes from partners who are traditionally underrepresented in this space.”    Most stock quote data provided by BATS.

business,Shell sues Greenpeace for $2.1 million after boarding oil vessel,https://edition.cnn.com/2023/11/09/energy/shell-sues-greenpeace-oil-vessel-climate-intl/index.html,"Markets     Fear & Greed Index                  Latest Market News            Shell is suing Greenpeace for $2.1 million in damages after the environmental group’s activists boarded the company’s oil production vessel in transit at sea this year, according to Greenpeace and a document seen by Reuters.           The British oil and gas major filed the claim in London’s High Court. Greenpeace activists boarded the vessel in January near the Canary Islands off the Atlantic coast of northern Africa to protest oil drilling and traveled on it as far as Norway.           In an email to Reuters, Shell confirmed legal proceedings were taking place when asked whether it was suing Greenpeace over the incident but declined to comment on the claim amounts.           Boarding a moving vessel at sea was “unlawful and extremely dangerous,” a Shell spokesperson said.           “The right to protest is fundamental and we respect it absolutely. But it must be done safely and lawfully,” the spokesperson said.           The vessel was destined for the Penguins oil and gas field in the North Sea, which is not yet in production.           Four Greenpeace activists used ropes to hoist themselves onto the vessel from inflatable boats that chased the ship at high speed.           Protests at sea against oil, gas or mining infrastructure have long been part of Greenpeace’s operations.           The damages Shell is seeking include costs related to shipping delays and expenses for extra security, as well as legal costs, according to a document seen by Reuters.     Greenpeace activists scale Shell oil platform in the Atlantic Ocean as company announces record profits         “The claim is one of the biggest legal threats against the Greenpeace network’s ability to campaign in the organisation’s more than 50-year history,” Greenpeace said in a statement.           The group said Shell offered to reduce its damage claim to $1.4 million if Greenpeace’s activists agree not to protest again at any of Shell’s oil and gas infrastructure at sea or in port.           Greenpeace said it would only do so if Shell complied with a 2021 Dutch court order to cut its emissions by 45% by 2030, which Shell has appealed.           A claim for additional damages of around $6.5 million by one of Shell’s contractors, Fluor, is unresolved, according to the document seen by Reuters. Fluor did not immediately respond to a request for comment.           Shell and Greenpeace have held negotiations since the case was filed, but talks ended in early November, Greenpeace said, adding it was now waiting for Shell to file further documents in court.           Greenpeace said it will then consider its next steps, including ways to stop the case from proceeding.    Most stock quote data provided by BATS.

business,The US presidential election is next year. Here’s what that could mean for stocks,https://edition.cnn.com/2023/11/09/investing/premarket-stocks-trading-presidential-election/index.html,"Markets     Fear & Greed Index                  Latest Market News      A version of this story first appeared in CNN Business’ Before the Bell newsletter.

If history is any indication, stocks could end 2023 higher and extend those gains next year.           The S&P 500 index has climbed 14% in 2023, as Wall Street’s infatuation with artificial intelligence and optimism that the Federal Reserve could soon stop hiking interest rates have helped power stocks higher.           Wall Street has a laundry list of uncertainties that it worries could threaten the current stock rally, including the upcoming presidential election. But history shows that stocks typically gain during the fourth year of presidential terms.     Nothing is certain: Ongoing geopolitical strife in the Middle East, Russia and Ukraine could inject fear into the market and bump up prices for commodities like oil. Some economists warn that the lagged effects of the Fed’s interest rate hikes have yet to take full effect on the labor market and consumers’ pocketbooks.           There’s also the possibility of a recession, as the central bank’s benchmark lending rate hovers at its highest level in 22 years.           Of course, many economists and investors have pared back or axed their recession expectations in recent months, as the labor market and broader economy have proved largely resistant to the Fed’s punishing pace of rate hikes, and markets seem to believe the central bank is done raising rates this year.           The New York Fed, which gauges the risk of recessions by tracking the spread of 3-month and 10-year Treasury yields, estimates that there’s a 56% probability that the US economy will tip into a recession by September 2024.     The period right after Election Day tends to be positive for stocks: Darrell Crate, managing principal at Easterly Asset Management, said an election tends to help cut through ambiguity on Wall Street. Investors hate little more than uncertainty.           “The election is a process that creates clarity on the investing environment for the next two to four years,” said Crate. “There are fiscal policies that need to be refined, there are regulatory issues where the die will be cast.”           The S&P 500 index has added 5% in the eight weeks following Election Day through the end of the year in the median election year since 1984, compared to a 2.6% gain during the same period during non-election years, according to Goldman Sachs.           Still, stocks could see a milder rally next year. The S&P 500 has gained 6.2% on average during the fourth year of presidential terms since 1932, according to Yardeni Research. That’s below the 13.5% gain the index has averaged during the third year of presidential terms since 1931.           That makes sense when considering candidates’ priorities before voters start lining up at the polls, says Joe Abbott, chief quantitative strategist at Yardeni Research.           “Presidents and political parties want to have a strong economy and stock market in their favor before they hit the campaign trail in the fourth year,” wrote Abbott in an email to CNN.           During the first and second years of presidential terms, the S&P 500 has risen 6.7% and 3.3% on average, respectively, according to the same dataset.           Federal Reserve Bank of Cleveland President Loretta Mester is set to retire from her post next year, the bank announced Wednesday.           Mester, one of the US central bank’s most “hawkish” voices, is finishing her term on June 30, 2024, report my colleagues Bryan Mena and Elisabeth Buchwald. Hawkish is a term used to describe Fed officials who take a strong stance on combating inflation despite the downside risks to the economy.           For instance, after inflation exploded in 2021, Mester was one of several Fed officials who called for bigger rate increases once the central bank began to lift rates. In recent months, as other Fed officials said they should keep rates on hold, she was among a few others who felt there’s a bit more room to raise rates.           Regional Fed presidents serve terms that are limited by length of service and age. Mester has served in her role since June 2014 and is 65 years old.           The Cleveland Fed is now kicking off a search for Mester’s successor, led by a committee chaired by Heidi Gartland, deputy chair of the Cleveland Fed’s board of directors.           “We are committed to finding a new leader who can ensure the Bank continues to meet the high standard that President Mester has set,” Gartland said in a statement Wednesday.

General Motors has entered into a partnership with a small Wisconsin start-up, Niron Magnetics, to develop electric motor magnets that can be made without rare elements that are mostly sourced from China today, reports my colleague Peter Valdes-Dapena.           In electric vehicle motors, rapidly shifting magnetic fields spin a rotor made with magnets that contain “rare Earth minerals” such as terbium and dysprosium.           Niron Magnetics, currently a 60-person company headquartered in Minnesota, claims to have patented methods to make high-performance magnets using only iron and nitrogen, both readily accessible elements that will not require importation.           Besides geopolitical concerns surrounding importing minerals from China, using more common and accessible elements will also significantly reduce environmental impacts of mining and processing, according to Niron chief executive Jonathan Rowntree.           The technology could also make EV motors less expensive, he said, but declined to say by what percentage.     Read more here.    Most stock quote data provided by BATS.

It now takes nearly 41% of the median household’s monthly income to cover the principal and interest payments on a median-priced home, according to research from Intercontinental Exchange. It comes at a time of uncomfortably high prices after a bout with the worst inflation in a generation. Housing is eating up a bigger portion of paychecks as gas, groceries and other loan prices are sky high.           Housing now takes up the biggest chunk of paychecks since 1984, according to ICE, the owner of the New York Stock Exchange. That’s up 0.4% from last month’s report, which also showed America’s homes were at the least affordable level in 39 years.           The portion of households’ paychecks needed to pay for housing has surged in the past few decades. Over the past 35 years, this metric averaged less than 25%.           Wannabe homebuyers are getting hammered by a painful combination of high mortgage rates and high home prices. The one-two punch of has pushed the principal and interest payment needed to buy a median-priced home up by $144 over just the past month alone, according to ICE. For the first time, monthly payments are above $2,500 – and that doesn’t even include taxes, insurance or other fees.           “The situation was already dire,” Andy Walden, ICE’s vice president of enterprise research said in the report, adding that the recent jump in mortgage rates has made it even worse.           This problem is pushing the American dream further from reach for some prospective first-time homebuyers. They’ve been forced to rent instead, delaying their ability to build wealth through homeownership.           Turmoil in the bond market and the Federal Reserve’s war on inflation have driven up mortgage rates to levels unseen since 2000.           After seven consecutive weekly increases, the 30-year fixed rate mortgage dipped to an average of 7.76% in the week ending November 2, according to Freddie Mac.           That’s miles away from the pre-Covid rate of 3.8% in the fall of 2019. Aided by emergency action from the Fed, mortgage rates briefly tumbled below 2.7% in late 2020 and early 2021.           The higher mortgage rates go, the less home people can afford.           At today’s rates, monthly payments on a $500,000 home would stand at roughly $3,265 after putting 20% down.           That’s $1,165 more than two years ago, when mortgage rates were barely above 3%.           Despite high borrowing costs, home prices continue to rise amid a supply crunch.           US home prices climbed in August to a record high, marking the seventh straight month of increases, according to S&P CoreLogic Case-Shiller.           Of course, that’s good news for existing homeowners, assuming they don’t want to move.           It’s a key reason Americans’ net worth surged by a record 37% between 2019 and 2022, according to Fed data.           But some younger Americans who want to buy their first homes are on the outside looking in.           ICE notes that the last time housing affordability was this bad, the average home cost about 3.5 times median income. Today, that price-to-income ratio is much worse, at nearly six to one.

business,"Execs ignored the damage Instagram does to teens, Meta whistleblower tells Congress",https://edition.cnn.com/2023/11/07/tech/meta-ignored-warnings-instagrams-harm/index.html,"Markets     Fear & Greed Index                  Latest Market News            Meta’s top executives, including CEO Mark Zuckerberg, ignored warnings for years about harms to teens on its platforms such as Instagram, a company whistleblower told a Senate subcommittee on Tuesday.           Meta instead fosters a culture of “see no evil, hear no evil” that overlooks evidence of harm internally while publicly presenting carefully crafted metrics to downplay the issue, said Arturo Bejar, an ex-Facebook engineering director and consultant.           Bejar is the latest former insider to level public allegations that the tech giant knowingly turns a blind eye to problems that its policies and technology cannot cheaply or easily address.           Bejar’s testimony before members of the Senate Judiciary Committee comes after what he described as fruitless appeals to Zuckerberg and his lieutenants in the fall of 2021 based on research his team had conducted on the experiences of teens and other users of Meta’s platforms.           Tuesday’s hearing follows a public report by The Wall Street Journal last week that laid out many of Bejar’s claims, including that he first became motivated to study the issue because of unwanted sexual advances his own 14-year-old daughter received from strangers on Instagram.           “It is unacceptable that a 13-year-old girl gets propositioned on social media,” Bejar testified, citing a statistic from his research finding that more than 25% of 13-to-15-year-olds have reported receiving unwanted sexual advances on Instagram. “This is unacceptable, and my work has shown that it doesn’t need to be this way.”           Amid criticisms of its platforms, Meta has rolled out some 30 parental controls to manage who their kids can talk to or how much time they spend on Facebook and Instagram.           Tuesday’s hearing once again places Meta in the bipartisan crosshairs of Congress, which has long struggled to come up with laws and regulations for social media in the face of industry lobbying, First Amendment concerns and, in some cases, substantive policy disagreements between Republicans and Democrats. Meanwhile, both parties have united behind blaming Meta for contributing to a nationwide mental health crisis.           Bejar’s testimony arrives almost exactly two years after Frances Haugen, another former Meta employee and a member of the Council for Responsible Social Media, came forward with troves of internal documents that she said proved how Instagram was aware its service may be harming children.           Bejar’s research “is basically a smoking gun,” Haugen told CNN in an interview Tuesday.           “The fact that he has the emails and responses from senior executives like [former COO] Sheryl Sandberg, this is a really, really big deal,” Haugen said.           “Every day countless people inside and outside of Meta are working on how to help keep young people safe online,” said Meta spokesman Andy Stone in a statement. “The issues raised here regarding user perception surveys highlight one part of this effort, and surveys like these have led us to create features like anonymous notifications of potentially hurtful content and comment warnings.”           Stone added that while the specific user perception survey Bejar worked on is no longer run at the company, Meta still performs many other types of user perception surveys and that some of the tools it’s introduced for teens — such as a feature to silently mute other users — are a direct result of those surveys.           Lawmakers on Tuesday ripped into the social media giant, saying they were “in no way surprised” by Bejar’s allegations and calling for swift passage of legislation to rein in Meta and other tech giants.           “They hid from this committee and all of Congress evidence of the harms that they knew was credible,” said Connecticut Democratic Sen. Richard Blumenthal.           Missouri Republican Josh Hawley blasted Big Tech companies for spending “gobs” of money to gain “a hammerhold” on the legislative process and to thwart bills that would restrict the industry’s power. He also accused Meta of “cooking the books” on data related to mental health harms.           Tennessee Republican Sen. Marsha Blackburn noted that Instagram CEO Adam Mosseri had testified before the Senate soon after Bejar had notified him, Zuckerberg, Sandberg and Chief Product Officer Chris Cox about his concerns.           “In fact, [Mosseri] testified just a few months after you sent two emails to him about youth harms on the platform,” Blackburn said. “In his testimony, Mr. Mosseri said, and I quote, ‘we care deeply about the teens on Instagram, which is in part why we research complex issues like bullying and social comparison and make changes.’ Do you agree with his characterization?”           Bejar replied: “I agree with that they make research; I don’t agree that they make changes.”           “Isn’t it a fact that social media has lowered the cost of being an a-hole?” asked Louisiana Republican Sen. John Kennedy.           Bejar agreed. “Yes, I think using your term, they reward being an ‘a-hole,’” he said.           Bejar left Facebook in 2015 but returned as a consultant working on user well-being issues in 2019 following his daughter’s run-ins with unwanted sexual advances. Though his daughter reported the incidents, he said, Facebook did nothing.           Hired by Facebook to study the issue, Bejar said he soon ran into institutional hurdles.           “It seems to me that the company culture is one of, ‘see no evil, hear no evil,’” Bejar told lawmakers. “We don’t want to understand what people are experiencing. And we’re not willing to invest in that and the tools that will help.”           Meta has previously said that its incentives are aligned with users on safety issues and that Meta acts aggressively on harmful material because it knows users do not want to see it. But Bejar told lawmakers Tuesday he believes users’ experiences would meaningfully improve if Zuckerberg were required to disclose survey data on every earnings call about self-reported bad experiences on company platforms.           According to the Wall Street Journal, Bejar’s survey work found that more than 1 in 4 users under age 16 reported having a “bad experience” with Instagram as a result of “witnessing hostility against someone based on their race, religion or identity.”           “More than a fifth felt worse about themselves after viewing others’ posts,” the Journal wrote of Bejar’s research, “and 13% had experienced unwanted sexual advances in the past seven days.”           Other evidence from Bejar’s research presented Tuesday included that “nearly a third of young teens have seen discrimination based on gender, religion, race and sexual orientation,” according to Blumenthal.           One of Bejar’s key allegations is that Meta has poured enormous resources into automated detection of clearly rule-breaking content, while diverting resources away from costly human reviews of situations that do not neatly or explicitly violate Meta’s rules but that may be distressing to users nonetheless.           After Bejar contacted Zuckerberg, Sandberg, Cox and Mosseri, Sandberg wrote to him individually to sympathize, and Mosseri held a meeting with Bejar to discuss the matter, according to the Journal. But Bejar, who left the company weeks later in October 2021, maintains that his complaints went unaddressed and that he never heard from Zuckerberg at all.           Bejar’s evidence, which is part of a multistate federal lawsuit against Meta filed last month, could encourage more whistleblowers to come forward, said Haugen. And it fleshes out the incomplete picture that the public was presented when she first testified, she added.           Lawmakers including Hawley and Blumenthal vowed Tuesday to try to push a high-profile bill known as the Kids’ Online Safety Act across the finish line by the end of the year.           “Big Tech is very much in danger,” Blumenthal said, mentioning previous government actions to curb harmful products. He said everyday Americans understand “the harm being done” and compared it to harms from smoking. He said Big Tech is “the next Big Tobacco.”     CNN’s Samantha Kelly contributed reporting.

business,Most people would love a four-day workweek. But it doesn’t work for everyone,https://edition.cnn.com/2023/11/07/success/four-day-workweek-survey/index.html,"Markets     Fear & Greed Index                  Latest Market News            If you’ve always thought you might be happier with a four-day workweek, you’re hardly alone.           When asked how six different options would impact their well-being at work, a full 77% of US workers said a four-day, 40-hour workweek would have a positive impact, with 46% saying it would have an “extremely positive” effect and 31% saying it would have a “somewhat positive” effect.           That’s according to a survey released Tuesday by Gallup, in partnership with Bentley University. More than 3,200 employed US adults answered the well-being questions, among the nearly 5,500 people who took the broader survey.           In other words, they gave high marks to working the standard 40-hour week, just over four days instead of five.           While studies of four-day workweek experiments in the United States and Europe have found generally positive results in terms of employee productivity and well-being, it’s not necessarily a positive for everyone in every situation. As with hybrid work, much will depend both on how your four days are scheduled, where you work and your individual work style.     Why do we work 9 to 5? The history of the eight-hour workday         Last year, Gallup found that among more than 12,000 full-time employees, 84% said they worked five days a week and 8% said they worked four days a week. Those on the four-day schedule did not report a significantly higher level of well-being than those who worked five days — and they reported higher levels of burnout.           “The reason for this is likely that the four-day workweek might work for some people and some jobs, but could cause issues in other situations,” said Jim Harter﻿, Gallup’s chief scientist for workplace management and wellbeing. “Outside studies support this. Burnout is a work-related syndrome. If people are forced to cram their work into four days when they prefer five — and if they need longer days to do so — it could cause burnout.”           Another influence, Hart﻿er said, might be the type of job you have. Those who always have to work onsite might get a greater benefit from a four-day workweek because it provides an element of flexibility that they don’t have now. “Whereas, in remote-ready jobs, there is some built-in flexibility, which may create less need for a four-day workweek,” he noted.           While the four-day workweek was the top pick overall in the newly released Gallup survey, when it comes to having a positive impact on well-being, two other options were not far behind. Respondents gave the next-highest marks to employers offering a set number of paid mental health days (74%) and limiting the amount of work employees are expected to do beyond the regular workday (73%).           When it comes to after-hours work, more than 60% of respondents said they thought their well-being would improve if employers limit the amount of time employees are expected to spend working on email after hours (66%). And more than 60% also expected a positive impact if they were offered free mental health counseling sessions (65%) and mental health screenings (61%).    Most stock quote data provided by BATS.

How do you interview election deniers? George Stephanopoulos offered an example on Sunday.           In a remarkable exchange with Rep. Steve Scalise that aired on “This Week,” the ABC News anchor pressed the Republican House Majority Leader no less than a half dozen times on what should have been a simple and painless matter: unequivocally stating that the 2020 election was not stolen by President Joe Biden.           Scalise repeatedly attempted to   evade the question, but Stephanopoulos held firm, relentlessly confronting   the Republican again and again with the straightforward   query.           “I asked you a very, very   simple question. Now, I have asked, I think, the fifth time and you can’t   appear to answer,” an exasperated Stephanopoulos said as the interview   descended into a grilling. “Can you say unequivocally the 2020 election   wasn’t stolen?”           Scalise never did offer a direct answer to the question (though you could argue his awkward dodging spoke volumes) and the interview ended after it was clear one would not be given. Stephanopoulos told me Monday that he was never going to move on to another topic until Scalise answered the unambiguous question, which proved impossible for the congressman.           “In my mind, if you can’t say   the election is not stolen, why move on to other things? Why should anything   else have any credibility?” Stephanopoulos rhetorically asked me when we   chatted by phone.           “You don’t move on from   whether an election is stolen,” Stephanopoulos added. “This is not   just another policy debate, it is fundamental.”           Stephanopoulos declined to comment   on how he believes other news anchors should approach the matter, but he   said, for him, it’s really not too complicated.           “We are a democracy. A   democracy is decided by elections. And the peaceful transfer of power, up   until 2020, was at the heart of our democratic tradition,” Stephanopoulos   told me. “If that can be called into question, then our whole democracy   can be called into question. In my mind, it is a foundational question, the   most fundamental question we face now as we head into the next   election.”           While the answer is simple in Stephanopoulos’ mind, newsrooms have spent untold amounts of energy discussing and debating best practices for engaging with election deniers. Those discussions are closely tied with the most profound question that continues to bedevil the news media: How to best cover Donald Trump.           As the disgraced former president walked into court on Monday, news outlets were again forced to grapple with the issue, particularly the cable networks that had to decide in real-time whether to air his remarks live to the public. The progressive news channel MSNBC aired just a few moments, before quickly cutting away. The right-wing channel Fox News, predictably, did air Trump’s remarks. And CNN did as well, carrying in full Trump’s unhinged tirade against Biden, the New York attorney general and so-called “thugs” who he ranted “must hate our country.”           I asked Stephanopoulos about the   uncertain waters that outlets once again found themselves in when covering   such events. Do you carry Trump’s remarks live when he delivers them,   particularly on days like Monday when he is in court? Do you believe, as some   do, that they carry some inherent news value?           “I don’t think we should be   in the business of airing falsehoods,” Stephanopoulos flatly said.           “The fact that he is going to   court is newsworthy,” he added. “The falsehoods are not.”           The civil fraud trial in which Trump testified under oath on Monday, of course, only presented the first of many thorny decisions that newsrooms will have to make over the next year as the Republican frontrunner is summoned to court to face criminal charges. And the looming 2024 election will surely result in an uptick of 2020 election denialism, given the debunked conspiracy theory’s hold on the Republican Party.           These issues will, without   question, continue to prompt significant debate among journalists. But for   Stephanopoulos, well, the answers are quite apparent.

A company spokesperson told CNN that Meta has updated its policies surrounding the advertising tools to restrict their use by ad campaigns that may be related to elections, politics and social issues.           The limitations also apply to ad campaigns that “qualify as ads for Housing, Employment or Credit,” or those that are “related to Health, Pharmaceuticals or Financial Services,” according to a public note appearing on the informational pages for the affected AI features.           “We believe this approach will allow us to better understand potential risks and build the right safeguards for the use of Generative AI in ads that relate to potentially sensitive topics in regulated industries,” the note continues.           The restrictions were first reported by Reuters.           The generative AI features in question include a tool that can automatically propose changes to content that is uploaded by advertisers and that offers to improve an ad’s effectiveness.

Other tools affected by the restrictions include one that creates product backgrounds and another that edits marketing text.           The restrictions come as policymakers and civil society groups have increasingly warned about the disruption that AI-generated content could wreak on the democratic process by misleading voters.           In September, a bipartisan group of US senators introduced legislation to ban the use of so-called AI “deepfakes” from political ads.

business,Deposit delays: Fed tells banks to get customers help,https://edition.cnn.com/2023/11/07/investing/bank-deposit-delays-help/index.html,"Markets     Fear & Greed Index                  Latest Market News            Federal Reserve officials are urging banks to work with customers hurt by ongoing deposit delays that have prevented some people from accessing their paychecks and other funds.           A number of customers still haven’t received their direct deposit paychecks following a “human error” that damaged the plumbing of America’s banking system. The deposit delays are linked to a problem that emerged on Friday with the Automated Clearing House (ACH) payments system, causing headaches for consumers and employers.           “The Federal Reserve encourages banks to work quickly to resolve issues for customers experiencing delays in receiving direct deposit payments as a result of operational issues at a private sector payments provider,” a Fed spokesman told CNN in a statement.           Fed officials signaled they want banks to help customers by waiving overdraft or late fees. The Consumer Financial Protection Bureau similarly told CNN on Monday that consumers “should not be penalized” by fees and penalties.           JPMorgan Chase has already said it will waive overdraft fees.           “The Federal Reserve’s payments services are separate and functioned normally,” the Fed spokesperson said on Tuesday.           Banks stressed to customers that all funds are secure. Payments that did not go through late last week had to be resent, a process that can take time.           It’s not clear how widespread the impact continues to be or how long it will take for all customers to receive their deposits.           The Clearing House, the private operator of ACH, told CNN on Monday it is working with banks and the Federal Reserve to “resolve this issue as quickly as possible.” It did not respond to requests for comment on Tuesday.           A Clearing House spokesperson said Monday that the problem started as a “processing error” on Thursday where some ACH payment instructions were sent to financial institutions with account numbers and customers “masked.” That missing data meant that some ACH payments were delayed.           The problem impacted less than 1% of the daily ACH volume in the United States, the Clearing House said. Of course, 1% of a massive system is still a large amount. The ACH Network processed an average of $330 billion per day in September, according to Nacha, a nonprofit that governs the network.           Bank of America and Chase are among the companies where users are reporting problems on Downdetector. Wells Fargo, US Bank, Truist and other banks where users reported problems on Friday ranked lower on Downdetector.    Most stock quote data provided by BATS.

business,WeWork files for bankruptcy,https://edition.cnn.com/2023/11/06/business/wework-bankruptcy/index.html,"Markets     Fear & Greed Index                  Latest Market News            WeWork, the beleaguered coworking space company, has filed for bankruptcy, marking a stunning downfall for what was once the world’s most valuable  startup.           The Chapter 11 bankruptcy announcement was widely expected after the company said last month it was struggling to pay back its debt. The pandemic rocked WeWork as people started working from home instead of commuting into office spaces. The company’s stock lost more than 99% of its value, and the SoftBank-backed venture, which was privately valued at around $47 billion at its peak, was worth $45 million Monday before its bankruptcy filing.           WeWork said it would remain open and operational as it renegotiates its leases and debt obligations. The company said late Monday that investors holding 92% of the company’s secured debt have agreed to adjust the terms of their loans to help the company remain in business.           “Now is the time for us to pull the future forward by aggressively addressing our legacy leases and dramatically improving our balance sheet,” said David Tolley, WeWork CEO, in a news release. “We remain committed to investing in our products, services, and world-class team of employees to support our community.”           Monday’s announcement does not impact WeWork outposts outside of the US and Canada.           Once a much-celebrated tech unicorn that promised to revolutionize the future of office work — via, among other things, free-flowing craft beer — a perfect storm of factors caused WeWork to start to come undone in the wake of a botched attempt to go public back in 2019.           At the time, IPO paperwork revealed larger-than-expected losses and potential conflicts of interest with the company’s cofounder and then-CEO Adam Neumann. Neumann, whose unorthodox leadership style resulted in WeWork’s culture becoming the subject of much news coverage, was ousted in 2019 following pressure from investors. (Notably, Neumann still received an eye-popping golden parachute upon his departure).           WeWork eventually went public roughly two years later at a much-reduced valuation of some $9 billion. But by 2021, market sentiment, and the easy access to capital that helped prop up much of the startup world before the pandemic, had started to shift. Although WeWork billed itself as a tech company, some critics noted its core business was not in tech but was really in real estate, renting space in office buildings to retrofit and sublet to startups, freelancers as well as large and small companies.           Even after going public, the company has struggled to turn the ship around. The flexible workspace provider was confronting a difficult time in the commercial real estate sector after the pandemic led to a rise in hybrid and work-from-home options – threatening the very office culture WeWork’s foundation was built upon. Meanwhile, increased competition in the coworking space, higher interest rates and macroeconomic uncertainty also cast a cloud over WeWork’s attempts to save itself over the past few years.           Shares for WeWork have plunged roughly 98% in 2023 alone. In May, WeWork announced a leadership shakeup with the departure of its chairman and CEO Sandeep Mathrani, a real estate executive who investors hoped would save the company. David Tolley, a WeWork board member, stepped up as interim chief executive and was officially named CEO in October. In August, meanwhile, the company said that it had “substantial doubt” about its ability to stay in business over the next year as losses and debt continued to mount.

business,Kahlúa created a $105 fragrance that smells like an espresso martini,https://edition.cnn.com/2023/11/07/business/espresso-martini-perfume/index.html,"Markets     Fear & Greed Index                  Latest Market News            For those that can’t get enough of espresso martinis, there’s now a gift that smells like the iconic cocktail that’s experiencing a resurgence for its 40th birthday.           Absolut Vodka and Kahlúa coffee liqueur, two spirits that are often mixed to create an espresso martini, are releasing a $105 fragrance called “Blend No. 83,” a nod to the year the drink was created.           This isn’t the first zany food-adjacent product from a big brand. KFC introduced “finger-lickin’ good nail polish” in 2016. And in 2020, McDonald’s sold scented candles that smell like quarter pounders.           The goal of these products is to pique customers’ curiosity, spark a conversation and increase brand recognition. In other words: It’s a marketing ploy disguised as a product for sale.           The scent mixes notes of dark chocolate, sugarcane rum, arabica coffee and night musk scent, the limited-edition fragrance floods the “senses with silk richness just as if sipping an espresso martini,” a press release said. The fragrance comes in a 1980s-inspired martini coupe-like bottle.           The espresso martini is a mix of vodka, coffee liqueur and espresso. It was said to have been invented at a London bar in the 80s when a model asked for a drink to “wake me up and f–k me up,” according to inventor and famed bartender Dick Bradsell.           The scent was inspired by a survey that cited 91% of drinkers say that when they smell coffee or an espresso, they want to order an espresso martini and that a “majority” of respondents consider it a holiday cocktail.           Orders open Tuesday only online with shipping beginning in early December in time for the holidays.           Both spirits are owned by French company Pernod Ricard, which recently reported a sales increase of 10% bolstered by growth of its core brands like Absolut and Kahúla.           Part of the company’s success can be attributed to the growing sales of Kahlúa. The rise of espresso martinis has made the 87-year-old brand more appealing to younger drinkers, according to Rima Sawaya, Kahlúa’s brand director.           “Consumers are craving anything nostalgic, as evident by the resurgence of trends from the ’80s and ‘90s in fashion, music, and of course, cocktails,” she previously told CNN. She added that the drink has “allowed a new generation of cocktail-curious consumers to taste and experience Kahlúa.”           Espresso martinis have been on the rise among drinkers for the past several years but broke through last year when it entered the top 10 list of most-ordered cocktails at US bars, according to CGA by NIQ data. It displaced the classic Manhattan from the list.           Lisa Hawkins​, senior vice president for public affairs for the Distilled Spirits Council, previously told CNN that the “convergence of two major US consumer trends: Americans’ affinity for high-end coffee and cocktail culture” explains why it’s having a moment.           “Spirits consumers are drawn to the simplicity and decadence of this cocktail,” she said. “The elegance of the espresso martini elevates your cocktail experience at a bar or restaurant, and it also serves as an impressive after-dinner cocktail when entertaining guests at home.”    Most stock quote data provided by BATS.

business,,https://edition.cnn.com/2022/04/27/business/diamonds-manmade-demand/index.html,"Markets     Fear & Greed Index                  Latest Market News            It’s proposal season, and engagements are on the rise. So are factory-made diamond sales.           Not that you’d know the difference. Man-made diamonds look the same as naturally occurring ones. The only noticeable difference is the price tag.           “The result is really stunning,” said Edahn Golan, an independent diamond industry analyst.           He said March data showed the number of engagement rings sold that featured a manufactured diamond jumped 63% compared to last year, while the number of engagement rings sold with a natural diamond declined 25% in the same period.           Going back by another month, to February, the data showed the number of rings sold with lab diamonds that month surged even more, to 80% compared to a year earlier while the number fell by 13% for natural diamond engagement rings.            “The big fear in the natural diamonds industry is that consumers will start accepting lab-grown diamonds in engagement rings,” he said. Too late. “It’s actually happening.”            Why are consumers flocking to man-made diamonds? Cost is the most obvious reason. The average retail price of the most popular one carat round man-made diamond for an engagement ring in March was $2,318, Golan said.           “This is substantially less – as much as 73% cheaper – than a natural diamond of the same size, cut and clarity as the man-made diamond, which would cost $8,740,” he said. Plus, the lower cost allows couples to buy a bigger stone.     Weddings are booming again. They're bigger and more expensive than ever         “A lab diamond is a real diamond, but maybe it took a few weeks to make it,” said Golan. “Natural diamonds were formed over 800 million to three billion years and there isn’t an infinite supply of them.”            This makes natural diamonds quite a bit more expensive, and prices are likely to rise as Russia’s invasion of Ukraine has tightened the supply chain for natural raw diamonds.           The sanctions directly target Alrosa, partly owned by the Russian government, which the US government identified as the world’s largest diamond mining company, accounting for 28% of global diamond output.     Key supply of diamonds caught up in Russia sanctions         Man-made diamonds are also becoming popular as consumers are more aware and educated about them, said Dan Moran, a third-generation diamond expert and owner of LA-based fine jeweler Concierge Diamonds. Moran said the typical buyer of man-made diamonds is typically younger than 40 and very budget conscious.           Mined diamonds have a controversial history that’s tied to the use of child labor in some African diamond mines as well as sales of illegally-traded “conflict diamonds” that fund conflict in war-torn areas.           Among Millennials and Gen Z, their eco-conscious mindset and ethical concerns about natural diamond sourcing is another factor influencing their preference for non-traditional engagement rings, according to a report from wedding planning website The Knot.           Although its slice is growing, the market share for man-made diamonds remains relatively small.           Currently, about 7% of the specialty diamond jewelry market is represented by man-made diamonds, up from 3% in 2020, said Golan.            Some major jewelry retailers are driving the effort to take man-made diamonds mainstream. In 2021, the world’s largest jewelry company, Pandora                              (PANDY), made a major shift by announcing it would stop using mined diamonds and would swap to lab-created diamonds in its jewelry.            Pandora said it’s instituting the change as part of an effort to sell sustainable jewelry, and also because consumers increasingly are asking for it.           Signet,                              (SIG) the largest jewelry company in the United States (which owns Zales, Kay Jewelers and Jared chains) called out the popularity of lab diamond jewelry in its March earnings call with analysts.           Calling it a “fast-growing category” in its jewelry portfolio, Signet CEO Virginia Drosos told analysts that lab-created diamonds are among the big jewelry trends she expects this year.            The company said it has expanded its man-made bridal jewelry selection in both its Zales and Kay Jewelers stores in response to the increased demand.            Fine jewelry brand Charles and Colvard, which makes lab-created diamonds, said consumers don’t just want to look good with the jewelry they are wearing, they also want to feel good about it.           “As the momentum for conscious consumerism grows, the surge towards lab grown diamonds isn’t surprising,” said Don O’Connell, president and CEO of Charles & Colvard. “[Consumers] want to know the origins of their stones and be reassured they’re conflict-free. They’re embracing the choice to purchase a piece of fine jewelry that aligns with their values.”           Lab-grown diamond brand VRAI said the pandemic, too, has sparked attention and action toward social and environmental issues. It said consumers are being more thoughtful and reassessing their purchasing habits, as well as the companies and industries they are supporting.           There is, however, one important consideration for anyone buying lab-created diamonds: Man-made diamonds have little resale value.            So while you may not be able to tell a natural diamond from a factory made variety, someone with a trained eye can, said Golan. Once a stone is identified as a factory diamond, even though you paid a lot less for it, you also won’t get much for it.            But the value of a ring isn’t just monetary.           “As a professional in the industry, I am asked all the time by people about what I think about a ring they have,” said Moran, of Concierge Jewelers. “I always say, if you love it, be happy with it. An engagement ring is a symbol of commitment and enduring love.”    Most stock quote data provided by BATS.

business,Why lab-grown diamond sales are surging,https://edition.cnn.com/2022/04/27/business/diamonds-manmade-demand/index.html,"Markets     Fear & Greed Index                  Latest Market News            It’s proposal season, and engagements are on the rise. So are factory-made diamond sales.           Not that you’d know the difference. Man-made diamonds look the same as naturally occurring ones. The only noticeable difference is the price tag.           “The result is really stunning,” said Edahn Golan, an independent diamond industry analyst.           He said March data showed the number of engagement rings sold that featured a manufactured diamond jumped 63% compared to last year, while the number of engagement rings sold with a natural diamond declined 25% in the same period.           Going back by another month, to February, the data showed the number of rings sold with lab diamonds that month surged even more, to 80% compared to a year earlier while the number fell by 13% for natural diamond engagement rings.            “The big fear in the natural diamonds industry is that consumers will start accepting lab-grown diamonds in engagement rings,” he said. Too late. “It’s actually happening.”            Why are consumers flocking to man-made diamonds? Cost is the most obvious reason. The average retail price of the most popular one carat round man-made diamond for an engagement ring in March was $2,318, Golan said.           “This is substantially less – as much as 73% cheaper – than a natural diamond of the same size, cut and clarity as the man-made diamond, which would cost $8,740,” he said. Plus, the lower cost allows couples to buy a bigger stone.     Weddings are booming again. They're bigger and more expensive than ever         “A lab diamond is a real diamond, but maybe it took a few weeks to make it,” said Golan. “Natural diamonds were formed over 800 million to three billion years and there isn’t an infinite supply of them.”            This makes natural diamonds quite a bit more expensive, and prices are likely to rise as Russia’s invasion of Ukraine has tightened the supply chain for natural raw diamonds.           The sanctions directly target Alrosa, partly owned by the Russian government, which the US government identified as the world’s largest diamond mining company, accounting for 28% of global diamond output.     Key supply of diamonds caught up in Russia sanctions         Man-made diamonds are also becoming popular as consumers are more aware and educated about them, said Dan Moran, a third-generation diamond expert and owner of LA-based fine jeweler Concierge Diamonds. Moran said the typical buyer of man-made diamonds is typically younger than 40 and very budget conscious.           Mined diamonds have a controversial history that’s tied to the use of child labor in some African diamond mines as well as sales of illegally-traded “conflict diamonds” that fund conflict in war-torn areas.           Among Millennials and Gen Z, their eco-conscious mindset and ethical concerns about natural diamond sourcing is another factor influencing their preference for non-traditional engagement rings, according to a report from wedding planning website The Knot.           Although its slice is growing, the market share for man-made diamonds remains relatively small.           Currently, about 7% of the specialty diamond jewelry market is represented by man-made diamonds, up from 3% in 2020, said Golan.            Some major jewelry retailers are driving the effort to take man-made diamonds mainstream. In 2021, the world’s largest jewelry company, Pandora                              (PANDY), made a major shift by announcing it would stop using mined diamonds and would swap to lab-created diamonds in its jewelry.            Pandora said it’s instituting the change as part of an effort to sell sustainable jewelry, and also because consumers increasingly are asking for it.           Signet,                              (SIG) the largest jewelry company in the United States (which owns Zales, Kay Jewelers and Jared chains) called out the popularity of lab diamond jewelry in its March earnings call with analysts.           Calling it a “fast-growing category” in its jewelry portfolio, Signet CEO Virginia Drosos told analysts that lab-created diamonds are among the big jewelry trends she expects this year.            The company said it has expanded its man-made bridal jewelry selection in both its Zales and Kay Jewelers stores in response to the increased demand.            Fine jewelry brand Charles and Colvard, which makes lab-created diamonds, said consumers don’t just want to look good with the jewelry they are wearing, they also want to feel good about it.           “As the momentum for conscious consumerism grows, the surge towards lab grown diamonds isn’t surprising,” said Don O’Connell, president and CEO of Charles & Colvard. “[Consumers] want to know the origins of their stones and be reassured they’re conflict-free. They’re embracing the choice to purchase a piece of fine jewelry that aligns with their values.”           Lab-grown diamond brand VRAI said the pandemic, too, has sparked attention and action toward social and environmental issues. It said consumers are being more thoughtful and reassessing their purchasing habits, as well as the companies and industries they are supporting.           There is, however, one important consideration for anyone buying lab-created diamonds: Man-made diamonds have little resale value.            So while you may not be able to tell a natural diamond from a factory made variety, someone with a trained eye can, said Golan. Once a stone is identified as a factory diamond, even though you paid a lot less for it, you also won’t get much for it.            But the value of a ring isn’t just monetary.           “As a professional in the industry, I am asked all the time by people about what I think about a ring they have,” said Moran, of Concierge Jewelers. “I always say, if you love it, be happy with it. An engagement ring is a symbol of commitment and enduring love.”    Most stock quote data provided by BATS.

business,The Chevrolet Corvette is officially going electric,https://edition.cnn.com/2022/04/25/business/electric-hybrid-corvette/index.html,"Markets     Fear & Greed Index                  Latest Market News            General Motors will produce a fully electric Chevrolet Corvette, GM President Mark Reuss announced in a LinkedIn post Monday morning.            Reuss didn’t say when the electric Corvette would come, but he hinted that a hybrid model could come relatively soon. “We will offer an electrified Corvette as early as next year,” he wrote. An accompanying video the company posted to Twitter showed what appeared to be a hybrid Corvette, and in another first, showed the front wheels spinning and throwing snow as if being powered. All Corvettes produced by the company previously have been rear-wheel-drive only.           While Reuss’s post implies a hybrid Corvette will be based on the current generation of the car, it’s not clear if the all-electric version will be a variation of this car or a completely different future model.           “Electrified” is an auto industry term encompassing everything from hybrid to fully electric vehicles, and anything with an electric motor can count as “electrified.” It has long been rumored that the current generation of the Corvette, the first with its gasoline engine mounted behind the seats instead of in the front, could be built with a hybrid system. Reuss has also previously hinted there would be electrified variants of the car.           Various companies are working on electric sports cars. Most all-electric vehicles in production so far have been four-door sedans and SUVs, as the need for batteries lends itself to larger and heavier vehicles. Tesla’s first car, the Lotus Elise-based Tesla Roadster, was an electric sports car, but the second-generation of Tesla Roadster, originally unveiled as a prototype in 2017, has yet to go into production.           Some manufacturers, such as Lamborghini, have said that current battery technology doesn’t allow for a optimum sports car performance from a purely electric vehicle. Lamborghini has been working on plug-in hybrid sports cars, though.           To date, the Corvette is only available in the base Stingray version with 6.2-liter V8 engine producing up to 495 horsepower. A 670 horsepower Corvette Z06 with a 5.5-liter V8 was unveiled last fall. The previous generation of the Corvette included included a 755-horsepower ZR1 version. Nothing like that has yet been announced for the current model but GM engineers have said a major reason for putting the engine in the back was to allow for better performance at extremely high horsepower levels.           Besides saving gas, hybrid systems can also be used in high-performance cars to add additional power and to provide for quicker acceleration since electric motors can provide power to the wheels more quickly than gas engines. Ferrari’s most powerful sports cars are hybrids, for instance.             GM has said it plans to produce only zero-emission vehicles, meaning fully electric or powered by hydrogen fuel cells, by 2035.    Most stock quote data provided by BATS.

business,This social app prohibits edited photos to encourage users to be more authentic. It’s growing fast,https://edition.cnn.com/2022/04/21/business/bereal-social-media-app-cec/index.html,"Markets     Fear & Greed Index                  Latest Market News            Scoot over, Facebook and Instagram.             There’s a newer photo-sharing app – and it’s not like other social media platforms.            The app is called BeReal. And while you may not have heard of it, a lot of young people are signing up. Its active monthly users have skyrocketed this year by more than 315%, according to data from Apptopia, which tracks and analyzes performance.            We joined the app and talked to users to get a deeper understanding of how BeReal works and what you need to know about it.            BeReal is a social media app that encourages users to share a slice of their life in real time. It was launched in early 2020 by an entrepreneur in France but a majority of its users – at least 65% – have signed up this calendar year.           As its name suggests, the focus is on authenticity. Users are invited once a day to share a photo of what they’re doing at that moment, giving friends and others an unvarnished glimpse into their life.            It has no filters and no edit buttons. So if your hair is a mess at that moment and your view is of a rainy parking lot, that’s what people will see.           The result is a far cry from the polished, overly curated photos popular on other social media platforms.            The concept of BeReal is simple. Once you download the app, you get a notification once a day that it’s time to “BeReal.”  That means you have two minutes to snap and post a photo of what you’re doing, no matter how mundane.            There’s no set time – the notification comes at random times of the day – adding to the app’s mystique.            “Push notifications are sent around the world simultaneously at different times each day,” the company said in a statement. “It’s a secret on how the time is chosen every day, it’s not random.”           That means the potential window into your life can open at any time. When it does, the app invites you to take a photo of what you’re up to at that moment. It takes a dual photo – a selfie and one showing what’s in front of you.  (BeReal doesn’t permit videos yet.)           The result is a social feed filled with unedited photos of people doing mostly everyday, unglamorous things – lounging in pajamas, doing homework, riding the bus, microwaving their dinner.            With only one post a day, there’s no clutter of friends’ pictures to mindlessly scroll through. You can only see friends’ posts if you share a photo, which eliminates lurkers. Some people turn off their location for privacy reasons, since the app works in real time.           Georgetown University student Ben Telerski, 21, is an avid social media user and joined the app in August.            “What I like about BeReal is I am able to make connections with my friends via social media on a platform that does not incentivize likes, comments, or being artificial. … solely showing your friends what you are doing at the moment that the daily alert goes off,” says Telerski, a junior majoring in government.            Telerski says the posts he sees on the app are generally more authentic compared to other social media platforms.            “I try to post as soon as I see the notification, even if I am just sitting in bed or walking to class,” he says. “I think the amount of authenticity depends on the persona each person creates on social media. If someone tries to keep their social media presence highly polished and produced, BeReal is not the app to use.”           When you click on the once-a-day BeReal notification, your camera opens within the app along with a timer with a two-minute countdown. You have until the timer runs out to take a picture of what’s in front of you. At the same time, your rear-facing camera snaps a selfie.           The app will share both images. You can retake them anytime during the two minutes and share them with friends when you’re ready.            BeReal also allows users to take and post the photo later in the day. But it lets your friends know how many hours past the notification that you posted. In short, it puts you on blast for your lack of spontaneity.            BeReal has tapped into marketing on college campuses. It recruits young users via its college ambassador program, which allows students to host events that educate others about the app.            Telerski believes the app is popular because it’s an antidote to the pressures to look perfect online.           “I have seen a lot of news coverage lately about the negative mental health impacts that social media has on Gen Z. I do not know if BeReal is directly attempting to combat this problem, but it is certainly making some ground toward that goal,” he says.              BeReal won’t make you famous, if you want to become an influencer you can stay on TikTok and Instagram.                   BeReal                 Morgan Nott, 26, manages a tea shop in Reno and is a newbie on the app. She started using it last week at a friend’s suggestion. Nott says she finds it refreshing to get a non-airbrushed, non-idealized glimpse into other people’s lives.           “It’s the authenticity of it that makes it so appealing. Users aren’t as glamorized or fake as some can portray themselves on other platforms,” she says. “It’s something different.”           In a statement, BeReal says its goal is to create “an alternative to addictive social networks” that focus on amassing influence, it says.            “BeReal is your chance to show your friends who you really are,”  the company says. “BeReal won’t make you famous, if you want to become an influencer you can stay on TikTok and Instagram.”           The app doesn’t give you much time to put on makeup or stage your surroundings before you snap and post photos.            But some users may still try to curate their lives on the app.           “There is the potential to be just as artificial on BeReal as people tend to be on other platforms,” Telerski says. Some people might ignore the notification to post at a certain time and wait to post until they are dressed up and out at dinner with friends, he says.            “It is not in the spirit of BeReal and entirely defeats the purpose,” he says. “BeReal should be full of pictures of (people) walking, doing homework and sitting in bed watching Netflix.”             The young people CNN spoke to have no plans to give up Instagram, TikTok and other social media apps.           Nott says she plans to keep letting her guard down on BeReal – and to keep posting on other social media platforms as well.            Telerski says he tries to maintain a certain level of authenticity on social media regardless of the platform. Authenticity is determined by a person, not an app, he says.            “For those who think we need a new social media app in order to be truly authentic, maybe we should take that as a sign to be more authentic throughout our existing social media presence,” he says.             “Think about what social media was originally intended for – real connection through family and friends keeping up with your life. Maybe we should get back to that.”    Most stock quote data provided by BATS. US market indices are shown in real time, except for the S&P 500 which is refreshed every two minutes. All times are ET.

business,"BMW reveals its new $120,000 electric flagship",https://edition.cnn.com/2022/04/20/business/bmw-i7/index.html,"Markets     Fear & Greed Index                  Latest Market News            Electric vehicles, with their need for lots of expensive batteries, have often trended towards luxury. Electric cars from Porsche, Mercedes, and Audi have all hit the market in recent years. BMW has come out with its own electric cars like the iX and i4 and now the new i7, a battery-powered take on the brand’s new most expensive sedan.           While BMW is probably better known for its smaller 3 Series and 4 Series cars, the 7 Series is the brand’s showpiece for luxury and technology. The i7 is the electric version of a new generation of the BMW 7 Series flagship unveiled on Wednesday.           With a starting price of $119,300, the all-wheel-drive 536 horsepower i7 xDrive60 will be able to go 300 miles on a full charge, which is less than the competing Mercedes EQS or Lucid Air. It will also offer a V8-powered gasoline version, the 760i X-drive, with the same horsepower output and a starting price that’s $300 less. It will look almost identical. A gas-powered version with a 6-cylinder engine will have a starting price of $93,300.           This new version also highlights BMW’s flexibility-first electric vehicle strategy, which is different from that of luxury competitors like Mercedes-Benz and Audi. While those other luxury brands’ electric vehicles are based on dedicated EV chassis with little relationship to their gas-powered models, BMW emphasizes adaptable engineering as its edge.           BMW has engineered all its new models so they can be built with internal combustion engines, fully electric power or as plug-in hybrids that combine both electric and gas power. BMW executives insist this is not just a matter of fitting batteries and electric motors into cars that were intended to have gas engines. Instead, these vehicles have been designed, from the outset, to be built with any of these drive systems.           A major benefit of doing it this way, BMW executives say, is that it gives the company flexibility to easily produce more – or fewer – electric cars or gas-powered cars on the same assembly lines rather than having to commit manufacturing resources just to EVs. With cars and SUVs designed to be built as either, the car maker also doesn’t risk putting millions of dollars of development costs into an electric-only model that might find little demand in some markets.           Another benefit, BMW chairman Oliver Zipse said, is that customers needn’t choose between two completely different models when deciding whether they want an electric or gas-powered car. They can just decide they want to buy a BMW 7 Series, then choose whether they want the gasoline or electric version, just as they might decide whether they want a V8 or a straight-6 engine. Either way, customers get the same luxury car experience and design.           The downside of a common engineering platform is that, to enable both electric and gasoline power, designers need compromises. Cars with internal combustion engines need a large amount of free space up front for the engine, a smaller one typically under the trunk for the fuel tank, and often a long tunnel down the middle to connect the engine to the wheels. Electric cars, on the other hand, can have smaller electric motors mounted closer to individual wheels, and while they don’t have a fuel tank or a transmission tunnel, they need a large, relatively flat area, typically on the bottom of the car, for the batteries.            The Mercedes EQS electric sedan, for example, has only a short hood that houses some electronic components, and it has a nearly flat floor allowing more interior storage space.           Zipse insisted the 7 Series represents a superior full-size luxury sedan regardless of its power source. The driving experience will be excellent, he said, as will interior comfort and technology.           “There is no car with a more spacious, luxurious second row,” he said, during a meeting with journalists.           Back seats are a major reason for buying this sort of large car. In full-size sedans, there generally isn’t much more room (if any) in the front seats compared to smaller cars. The extra space usually goes to those in the back.           As in many other high-end large cars, the back seats can recline while leg and foot rests rise from beneath seats. (BMW claims its seats recline more than competitors’, though.) The front passenger seat, if it’s unoccupied, can also move forward and fold down to allow more space.           BMW 7 Series buyers can get an optional 31-inch high-resolution video screen that folds down from the roof to provide entertainment for back seat passengers. Combined with an available high-end stereo system and powered window shades to block out light, the 7 Series can be a better place to watch a movie than someone’s own living room, according to BMW. Front seat occupants can also watch streaming videos on the center screen when the car is parked.           Four-wheel steering will enable the car to turn more tightly on curvy roads and in parking lots and to change lanes more smoothly on the highway. Inside, there are few knobs and buttons. Instead, buttons appear as lighted icons on a strip of what looks like decorative trim that runs across the dashboard.           The car’s headlights are obscured by dark coverings while, above them, turn signals and daytime running lights are housed in prominent narrow bars. As an option, the turn signals and daytime lights can include Swarovski crystals that sparkle in sunlight. As another option, the 7 Series’ large “kidney” grille can be outlined in lights at night.           For when the driver would rather not bother, assistance technologies allow the driver to completely let go of the steering wheel for long periods on divided highways. This technology, similar to General Motors’ Super Cruise, requires drives to keep their eyes on the road ahead at all times.            The 7 Series can automatically drive itself into and out of parking spaces even with the driver outside the vehicle using a smartphone app. It can also drive itself through a pre-programmed course, such as around pylons in a parking garage, on its own, a feature somewhat similar to Tesla’s Summon mode.           A sophisticated “head up display” which displays data in the car’s windscreen can align images and text so they appear as if laid over roads and other features in the real world. The system can also display parking regulations in the area.           Performance is a core part of BMW’s brand image. For decades, BMW’s marketing tagline was: “The Ultimate Driving Machine.” Executives now say that electric vehicles will take the lead in the carmaker’s performance pantheon with the fastest and most powerful versions of its vehicles being battery-powered. With the new 7 Series, the i7 shares its ranking as the most powerful version with the V8-powered 760i. There are no plans for a V12-powered 7-series model in this generation of the car.            A sophisticated air suspension works automatically to keep the car level even in fast turns. Computers can use data from GPS maps and cameras on the front of the car to predict when an upcoming curve will require the suspension system to react.           BMW has said that half of the cars the company sells worldwide will be electric by 2030. That includes Rolls-Royce and Mini vehicles. Both of those iconic British brands are owned by BMW, and plan to sell only electric vehicles by 2030.    Most stock quote data provided by BATS.

business,David Paul Morris/Bloomberg/Getty Images,https://edition.cnn.com/2023/11/06/tech/bumble-whitney-wolfe-herd-steps-down-as-ceo/index.html,"Markets     Fear & Greed Index                  Latest Market News            Bumble founder Whitney Wolfe Herd is stepping down as chief executive after nearly a decade running the dating app company.           Starting on January 2, Wolfe Herd will be succeeded by Lidiane Jones, a longtime tech executive who has been serving since December as the CEO of the workplace communication service Slack, Bumble confirmed in a securities filing Monday. Wolfe Herd will remain at Bumble as executive chair.           “This move to Executive Chair gives me the ability to step forward into a new and exciting role, get back to my founder roots and bring immense passion and focus to this next chapter of growth,” Wolfe Herd said in a statement, adding that she and Jones would be “fantastic partners.”           The leadership transition was first reported by the Wall Street Journal.           Wolfe Herd started her career at rival dating service Tinder, which she co-founded. But she left in 2014 and filed a lawsuit against the company alleging sexual harassment and discrimination, which was eventually settled.           She then launched Bumble based on the idea that giving women the chance to make the first move on a dating app would empower them with more control over their romantic lives. Wolfe Herd founded Bumble with the help of Andrey Andreev, the former owner of the dating app Badoo; in 2019, she became head of the combined company after Andreev was accused of racism and sexism.           Today, Bumble is the parent company of four apps — Bumble, Official, Badoo and Fruitz — and the Bumble app has expanded to include features to help people find friends and professional connections. The company has more than 3.6 million paying users across its apps, according to its most recent earnings report.           When Bumble made its initial public offering in 2021, Wolfe Herd, then 31, became one of the world’s youngest self-made female billionaires.           But since then, the company’s share price has foundered. Bumble (BMBL) shares opened trading at $76 dollars on the day of its IPO but are now trading below $14, a more than 80% decline. The company’s stock fell an another 8% on Monday following news of Wolfe Herd’s departure from the CEO role.           Bumble is set to report earnings for the quarter ended in September on Tuesday. Wall Street analysts expect the company’s sales to grow 19% from the year-ago quarter to to $276.9 million, but profits are projected to fall by 31% year-over-year, according to Refinitiv estimates.           Jones will take control of Bumble at a time when analysts are concerned that the uncertain economic environment could make consumers less likely to shell out for dating app subscriptions and as persistent inflation weighs on many tech companies’ earnings. Shares of Match Group, the Bumble competitor and Tinder parent company, tumbled last week after the company said in its earnings report for the September quarter that its number of paying customers had declined by 5% year-over-year. Bumble’s stock also dipped on news of Match’s earnings report.           Before taking over as CEO of Slack late last year, Jones spent four years in various executive roles at Slack parent company Salesforce, most recently as executive vice president of digital experiences. Prior to Salesforce, Jones was the vice president of software product management at speaker company Sonos and spent 12 years at Microsoft. Jones will remain at Slack through the end of this year.           “As a woman who has spent her career in technology, it’s a gift to lean on my experience to lead a company dedicated to women and encouraging equality, integrity and kindness, all deeply personal and inspiring to me,” Jones said in a statement about joining Bumble.

business,Bumble founder Whitney Wolfe Herd steps down as CEO. She’ll be replaced by Slack’s leader,https://edition.cnn.com/2023/11/06/tech/bumble-whitney-wolfe-herd-steps-down-as-ceo/index.html,"Markets     Fear & Greed Index                  Latest Market News            Bumble founder Whitney Wolfe Herd is stepping down as chief executive after nearly a decade running the dating app company.           Starting on January 2, Wolfe Herd will be succeeded by Lidiane Jones, a longtime tech executive who has been serving since December as the CEO of the workplace communication service Slack, Bumble confirmed in a securities filing Monday. Wolfe Herd will remain at Bumble as executive chair.           “This move to Executive Chair gives me the ability to step forward into a new and exciting role, get back to my founder roots and bring immense passion and focus to this next chapter of growth,” Wolfe Herd said in a statement, adding that she and Jones would be “fantastic partners.”           The leadership transition was first reported by the Wall Street Journal.           Wolfe Herd started her career at rival dating service Tinder, which she co-founded. But she left in 2014 and filed a lawsuit against the company alleging sexual harassment and discrimination, which was eventually settled.           She then launched Bumble based on the idea that giving women the chance to make the first move on a dating app would empower them with more control over their romantic lives. Wolfe Herd founded Bumble with the help of Andrey Andreev, the former owner of the dating app Badoo; in 2019, she became head of the combined company after Andreev was accused of racism and sexism.

business,Apple’s ‘scary fast’ upgrades hint at its vision for the AI era,https://edition.cnn.com/2023/11/01/tech/apple-ai-upgrades/index.html,"Markets     Fear & Greed Index                  Latest Market News            During an Apple product launch the night before Halloween, Apple CEO Tim Cook – wearing all black at its Cupertino, California-based headquarters – introduced the next phase of Mac computers which hint at a more AI- driven future.           The focus of the event, which featured the tagline “scary fast,” was Apple’s new custom-made M3 chips, the M3, M3 Pro and M3 Pro Max. These processors promise faster computing and graphics and longer-lasting battery life, but can also better support advancements with artificial intelligence because they’re made with 3 nanometer technology, according to the company. The chips will ship with Apple’s latest MacBook Pro and iMac lineup.           “They are the most advanced chips ever created for a personal computer,” Cook said. “This deep integration is something only Apple can deliver, and we never stop innovating.”           At a time companies such as Microsoft, Google and Meta have openly discussed their plans for an AI future, Apple has been less forthcoming. (It has, however, reportedly been working on its own generative AI tools to rival ChatGPT). Some analysts believe Apple’s vision for how it can support work in the AI field and harness the power of its new chip were evident from the Halloween event.           “Apple may not wax eloquent about AI but it knows very well that the use cases for this technology are booming and that the development work will require unprecedented computing power,” said Dipanjan Chatterjee, an analyst at Forrester. “That’s a huge emerging opportunity, and Apple wants a piece of that pie.”     ‘So, how hard can it be?’           During the presentation, Apple showed how researchers can conduct an analysis on an M3 device for complex tasks such as DNA/RNA sequencing, which could help detect early-stage cancers or help prevent pandemics, from anywhere in the world. It also touted a promo video that demonstrated how the Mac can be used to do anything from analyzing ECG signals to mapping the structure of the galaxies. “It’s hard work,” one actor in the video says. “But you’re on a Mac,” says another. “So how hard can it be?”           The upgrades come at a time when Apple is gaining substantial ground in the traditional PC and laptop market but still ranks fourth behind Lenovo, Dell and HP in the number of products shipped, according to IDC Research. Apple said it shipped about 26 million Macs in 2022, making up 9.1% of the overall market (up from 7.8% the year prior). At the same time, the overall PC market shipped about 292 million computers the same year, down 15% from the year before.           The iPhone and Apple services — such as iCloud, Apple TV+ and Apple Music — remain a major revenue driver for the company, but Macs and iPad sales have declined year over year, largely due to weaker demand, excess inventory and a worsening macroeconomic climate.           “Apple is looking for a revenue bump, especially going into the holidays, from the new iPhone 15, but the sense is that demand is tepid, especially out of China which is a significant market for the brand,” said Chatterjee. “If iPhone revenue slows down, something has to offset that.”     ‘Building their own sandbox’         It’s difficult, however, to predict how the new chip will impact the total sales of the computer market, according to David McQueen, a director at ABI Research. He said Apple aims to pit itself against Intel, as well as Qualcomm, AMD, NVIDIA and Dell, not only as a performance leader but with chips that support productivity-related AI tools.           “It is an important part of Apple’s strategy to make sure performance of its silicon can keep up with or ahead of its competitors,” McQueen said.           Meanwhile, Kieren Jessop, an analyst with UK-based market research firm Canalys, said it’s less about Apple catching up and more about “running their own race.”           “Apple’s emphasis on the ‘Pro’ user makes it clear they’re calling on developers to amplify the power of their platform … building their own sandbox for developers to build in,” he said.           Although Apple’s vision for the AI era is still not abundantly clear, the introduction of the M3 chip for its MacBook Pro and iMac lines “solidified its commitment to a future rich in AI integration,” he added.

business,Cold weather testing: Airplanes endure punishing extremes,https://edition.cnn.com/travel/article/plane-airbus-cold-weather-testing/index.html,"       With extremely cold temperatures gripping much of the United States, travelers may be wondering how their planes are made safe for flying.           The short answer: Along with regular deicing of planes before take-off, airlines put their aircraft through rigorous testing in some of the coldest places on the planet before they are ever pressed into service.           CNN has previously followed a team of Airbus engineers, mechanics and test pilots. Their mission was to see how their test plane, a long-range A350 XWB, withstood extreme cold.           The Airbus team left the warmth and comfort of their Toulouse, France, base to perform various extreme-weather trials on the test plane in frigid Iqaluit, the capital of Canada’s eastern Arctic territory of Nunavut.           The ground and in-air tests included operating the A350 XWB in temperatures reaching down to  -18 Fahrenheit (-28 degrees Celsius), thrust-reversed tests with snow and a local flight test.           All new plane models must be tested in extreme environmental conditions, from freezing to intense heat.            “Coming to an extreme place means we can break everything,” Airbus’ head of flight operations Pedro Dias told local reporters.            Extreme cold affects various parts of an aircraft in different ways. Metals, such as steel and aluminum, contract at different rates. Lubricants may lose their viscosity, creating friction and wear issues for moving parts. Meanwhile plastic and rubber parts could become brittle.           The cold-weather tests in Canada came only days after the MSN3 test plane completed high-altitude test in Bolivia. Next stop was Qatar for hot-weather testing.            For years Iqaluit, located on Baffin Island, has marketed itself as “a premier cold-weather test site.”            Airbus has tested there since the 1990s, while the airport has also hosted other civilian and military aircraft makers such as Boeing, Dassault and Eurocopter to perform similar trials.            But cold weather test sites also appear in unlikely places.     Four million parts, 30 countries: How an Airbus A380 comes together         In April 2010, Boeing chose McKinley Climatic Laboratory in Florida as the location for extreme-weather testing on its 787 Dreamliner.            In a test chamber the aircraft was given a “cold soak” and exposed to temperatures as low as -45 degrees Fahrenheit (-42.7 degrees Celsius) for hours.            Later, it had to endure temperatures as high as 115 degrees Fahrenheit (46 degrees Celsius), also for hours.            “These tests help us establish that our customers will get airplanes that work for them in all of the climates in which they operate around the globe (and in all seasons),” Randy Tinseth, vice president of marketing at Boeing Commercial Airplanes, said in a news release.             But extreme-weather trials are also affected by unpredictability of Mother Nature.            Initially scheduled for five days, Airbus’ tests in Iqaluit were cut short, not because of an impending winter blizzard but because of a balmy temperature of -18 degrees Celsius – too warm for the cold weather testing.

business,"In less than a week, Sam Bankman-Fried’s $16 billion fortune evaporated",https://edition.cnn.com/2022/11/11/business/sbf-wealth/index.html,"Markets     Fear & Greed Index                  Latest Market News      Sam Bankman-Fried woke up on Monday still a billionaire, even as his cryptocurrency empire was beginning to unravel. By Friday, his fortune was completely wiped out.           Based on net worth calculations by Bloomberg, Bankman-Fried was worth about $16 billion at the start of the week. But as his crypto exchange, FTX, collapsed, the value of his assets was reduced to zero in what Bloomberg called “one of history’s greatest-ever destructions of wealth.”     Crypto is in chaos as FTX files for bankruptcy         FTX on Friday said it filed for bankruptcy, and Bankman-Fried, known as SBF, resigned as chief executive.            The 30-year-old entrepreneur’s net worth, which was largely tied up in digital assets, peaked at around $26 billion this spring. Over the summer, as crypto prices plummeted, Bankman-Fried emerged as a white knight for the sector, using his FTX exchange and its sister hedge fund, Alameda, to secure lines of credit to crypto companies like BlockFi and Voyager that were at risk of collapsing.            He told Reuters in July that he and FTX still had a “few billion” on hand to shore up other firms and help stabilize the industry.            Bankman-Fried owns about 70% of FTX’s US business, which the index now estimates to be essentially worthless. His stake in online brokerage Robinhood, previously valued at more than $500 million, was removed from Bloomberg’s calculation after news reports said that stake was held through Alameda and may have been used as collateral for loans.           As a follower of “effective altruism,” Bankman-Fried has sought to make as much money as possible in order to give it away. But the fate of his philanthropic endeavors is now in doubt.            On Thursday, the entire staff of the FTX Future Fund, which says it has committed $160 million in grants, publicly quit. In a statement, the five-person team wrote that they “have fundamental questions about the legitimacy and integrity of the business operations that were funding the FTX Foundation and the Future Fund.”     Most stock quote data provided by BATS.

opinion,How the Biden administration can ensure mask access to all Americans,https://www.cnn.com/2022/01/19/opinions/covid-19-masks-recommendations-ha-bukhsh/index.html," Editor’s Note: Emmeline Ha, MD is a family physician and Miriam Bukhsh, MD is an emergency physician. They are health policy fellows at the George Washington University Department of Emergency Medicine. The opinions expressed in this commentary are their own. Read more opinion on CNN.         Health care workers vividly remember the anxiety surrounding mask access in the early days of the pandemic. The shortages of personal protective equipment in hospitals were so severe that it was an all-too-common occurrence to walk into work, only to find that there were no available N95 respirators in your size.            Hospitals did their best to come up with solutions to circumvent this shortage – including recommending repetitive use, performing ultraviolet light cleanings of used masks and simply rationing – but we still remember the stress of feeling physically under-protected.           Thankfully, as we enter year three of the pandemic, access to masks in the health care setting has improved. However, the Omicron variant has led to some of the highest daily case counts since the start of the pandemic and many states are utilizing greater than 70% of their inpatient and intensive care unit beds. The rapidly infectious nature of Omicron has made many public health leaders reconsider the approach to masking for the general public.           On Friday, the CDC updated its mask guidance for preventing the spread of Covid-19. The agency provided additional information about the various types of masks that are available and in which circumstances each type is appropriate. Overall, it is recommended that individuals wear masks that “fit well” and that they will “wear consistently,” with the understanding that higher quality masks like N95s and KN95s will offer more protection than a simple cloth mask if worn correctly.       What Justice Gorsuch's masklessness says about society         While higher quality masks provide better protection, multiple barriers prevent widespread public use of them. The Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) specifies that, when masks are required in the workplace, those masks must be approved by the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH). This has led to false marketing of non-NIOSH-approved masks and prompted the CDC to publish a guide on identifying counterfeits. On Project N95, a nonprofit organization which lists vetted masks and respirators, the prices for 20 N95s range from $27-$124. In addition to quality misrepresentation and financial limitations, proper size and fitting of these masks can vary from person to person.            President Joe Biden announced Thursday that his administration would make high-quality masks widely available and free for Americans. Also last week, Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders introduced legislation to provide three N95 masks to every American using the United States Postal Service for distribution and additional pick-up sites at community locations. While these are promising steps for increasing mask access, we strongly urge officials to value local partnerships in their initiatives.            If vaccine rollout and the testing shortages have taught us anything, it is that we need to be proactive in ensuring equitable access to these masks. While the administration has noted that the masks will be available at some local pharmacies and community centers, it will be critical to ensure that sufficient supply is available to those who have high risk exposure to the virus.           For example, those who work outside of the home and interact with others may need more masks than those who work from home. In addition, if the method of signing up for free masks is similar to the current federal government’s free at-home Covid-19 test website that went up Tuesday, individuals with broadband access issues and limited English proficiency may be unable to navigate these services.           We, therefore, recommend the following three venues for mask distribution that will address both equitable access and effective use.      Counterfeit N95 masks are everywhere. Here's how to spot them         The first location is in established areas where people are already receiving medical care. These include the community centers and pharmacies that the administration has noted will be distribution spots, but the list should extend to primary care clinics, hospitals, medical and dental centers, Covid-19 vaccination sites and Covid-19 testing centers. By partnering with local places that the general public regularly uses and trusts with their health, effective education and prevention can be achieved. A state-based program in Maryland is already pursuing this method and will soon be distributing high-quality masks at state-run testing and vaccination sites.            The second location is the workplace. Individual companies could put in requests for masks based on their number of employees. Given that a “high-quality” mask is one that is not wet or soiled, organizations would have to assess the likelihood of mask reusability depending upon the task the employee is hired to do and request masks for more frequent changing if needed.            Especially after the recent Supreme Court ruling blocking the general workplace vaccine mandate, masks can be a line of protection for vulnerable populations while at work. In Los Angeles, employers are already required to provide well-fitting medical-grade masks to employees who work indoors in close contact with others.           The third location that would benefit from high-quality mask distribution is schools. We have argued in the past that school mask mandates play an important role in fighting the spread of this virus. For younger children who are not yet eligible for the vaccine or whose household members are immunocompromised or unvaccinated, high-quality masks may be their primary source of protection during the school day.            There are no N95 respirators designed for children and only certain KN95s and medical-grade surgical masks are made to fit children. Given the difficulties in purchasing these masks (including costs and supply availability), school partnerships would provide more equitable access. The number of masks needed could be identified through school rosters and then allocated appropriately. States like Colorado have been distributing free at-home Covid-19 testing kits through school-based programs. Similar processes to this can be used to plan for mask distribution.       Sign up for our new newsletter.Join us on Twitter and Facebook         Compared to the early days of limited personal protective equipment, we have made great strides. When the administration releases their plans for mask distribution this week, we hope they take into account the lessons learned thus far from the pandemic. By distributing high-quality masks directly to the public where they are at, we can maximize protection against the SARS-CoV-2 virus – balancing equitable access and effective use for all.    © 2023 Cable News Network.

opinion,What 2020’s pro-Trump phony electors means for 2024,https://www.cnn.com/2022/01/19/opinions/2020-election-phony-electors-democracy-alexander/index.html," Editor’s Note: Robert Alexander is a professor of political science and founding director of the Institute for Civics and Public Policy at Ohio Northern University. He is also the author of “Representation and the Electoral College.” Follow him on Twitter: @onuprof. The opinions expressed in this commentary are his own. View more opinion at CNN.         As the January 6 House select committee continues to investigate the events surrounding the insurrection, there has been great interest in what is a typically overlooked, yet important component of the election process – the presidential electors who vote in the Electoral College.           I have spent 20 years studying these little known figures, warning about the potential hijinks they could cause. Yet even I have been surprised by what has been uncovered in the wake of the 2020 election. It has become clear that then-President Donald Trump wanted then-Vice President Mike Pence to use extraconstitutional powers to manipulate the tabulation of electoral votes to secure a second term despite his defeat in the election.           One component of this scheme was to send phony electors to cast ballots in closely contested states that were carried by President Joe Biden. At the time, Trump adviser Stephen Miller stated: “An alternate slate of electors in the contested states is going to vote and we’re going to send those results up to Congress.”             Upon hearing Miller’s remarks, I wrote that those votes amounted to “pretend votes” and would not be counted in Congress due to the existence of the Electoral Count Act of 1887 (ECA). The act came into existence nearly a decade after the disputed election of 1876 – and was meant to provide a means to avoid constitutional crises where multiple elector slates from the same state are sent to be counted before Congress. Among other things, the ECA requires that if Congress receives two electoral slates, it should count the slate carrying the state’s executive’s signature as the rightful slate.            Since all the states in question in 2020 were certified as Biden electoral votes by their respective state executives, I considered those “alternative” votes to be purely performative, not intended to be substantive. I was wrong. It had not occurred to me that the Trump team could try to jettison the ECA and rely on Pence to unilaterally accept or reject which slates of electors were legitimate.            After all, that would be akin to a self-coup. Apart from the traditional vision of a coup requiring a military takeover of the government, self-coups occur when governments depart from typical norms of democracy by altering election laws, calling into question election results or seeking to suspend their constitutions in order to stay in power.            I have long been curious as to who actually participated in this plot, so I submitted a Freedom of Information Act request from National Archives. I received copies of slates of these phony electors from seven states – Arizona, Georgia, Michigan, New Mexico, Nevada, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin.             Given the extraconstitutional nature of the scheme, I expected that most would be Trump partisans on the political fringe. Instead, most were elected party officials, political officeholders and other key figures in state Republican politics.           The return addresses on the certificates included the Arizona Republican Party, the Georgia Republican Party, the Republican Party of New Mexico, the Nevada Republican Party. Michigan’s came from Kathy Berden, who included the title, “Chair of the Michigan Republican Electoral College.” Pennsylvania’s was sent in by Bill Bachenberg, who referred to himself as the “Chairperson, Electoral College of Pennsylvania.” Wisconsin’s simply stated, “Chairperson of the Electoral College of Wisconsin.” When asked by The Detroit News about why she chose to participate in this scheme, Berden said, “I can’t comment on anything like that. That was a long time ago.” CNN reached out to Bachenberg for comment, but has not received a response.            It is notable that at least a few high-profile would-be electors chose not to participate in the scheme – former US Sen. Johnny Isakson of Georgia and former Michigan Secretary of State Terri Lynn Land being the most prominent among them. In total, of 84 people across seven states, 15 chose not to participate in this effort.            Still, that a majority were apparently willing to participate in such a dubious plot suggests that undemocratic efforts have been sanctioned by party regulars and will likely persist if gone unchecked.           Of course, these alternate slates weren’t without some glaring problems. The ECA stipulates that electoral votes should be certified by each state – accompanied with a signature by each state’s executive and delivered under each state’s seal. None of these alternate slates of electoral votes had a signature by a governor or a secretary of state, nor did they contain an official state seal.            The alternate Michigan electors in this scheme were turned away from entering the statehouse, which is where electors are required to assemble to cast their ballots by Michigan state law. In addition to falsely claiming they were the “duly elected” Michigan electors, the certificate that they submitted to Pence and the National Archives indicated that they signed it inside the statehouse (which they didn’t).            Much of the conversation around “alternate electors” now centers on the work of one of Trump’s lawyers, John Eastman, and his legal memo for how to overturn the results of the 2020 election. A key part of the memo had Pence introducing alternative slates of Republican electors in seven states that Trump did not win. In spite of the ECA, Eastman argued that Pence could unilaterally determine which of the two electoral slates should be counted – or potentially discard the votes from those seven states, claim that no candidate reached a majority of electoral votes and leave the selection of the president to the House of Representatives. Contrary to what he wrote in his memo, Eastman told the National Review last October that, “anybody who thinks that that’s a viable strategy is crazy.”            Ultimately, Pence did not carry out the plan offered by Eastman and championed by Trump. In handling the dueling slate of electors, he thankfully deferred to the ECA to guide his actions. Indeed, in spite of the noise created by the Big Lie about the 2020 presidential election results, every state certified its election results, courts dismissed more than 50 election-related lawsuits and federal officials found no evidence of widespread fraud, concluding that the election was the “most secure election in American history.”            However, given how far rogue electors in seven states went to undermine the election, it is clear further investigation and reforms are needed. First, the American people must learn who exactly was responsible for coordinating the effort to undo the 2020 elections. Identifying who organized the effort is a critical step toward accountability – both politically and legally. This underscores the important work of the January 6 committee.

Changes can include raising the standard to object to electoral votes, which is now set at only one senator and one House member, to a majority in both houses. Clarifying and limiting the vice president’s role in the joint session is another solution that should be considered. Notably, a House committee is currently considering reform.           What’s clear is that lawmakers must act now to prevent a similar occurrence in the 2024 election. There appears to be bipartisan momentum to do so, and the legitimacy of our presidential electoral system depends on it.    © 2023 Cable News Network. A Warner Bros. Discovery Company.

opinion,Leanza Abucayan/CNN,https://www.cnn.com/2021/11/08/opinions/democracy-autocracy-21st-century-fight-fredrick/index.html," Editor’s Note: In this series, “Voices of Freedom,” 13 dissidents from around the world share their stories and make the case for supporters of democracy to fight for restoring and protecting the rights to speak freely and vote in honest elections. They are active participants in Renew Democracy Initiative’s Frontlines of Freedom project.         Marina Nemat was only 13 years old when the freedom that she had taken for granted – singing in public, wearing a swimsuit at the beach and holding her boyfriend’s hand – was suddenly taken away.           But what shocked Nemat the most was the speed of her nation’s descent into a theocratic regime in 1979. Within a matter of months, she and her fellow Iranians lost the limited rights they had enjoyed under the country’s previous government, itself a repressive monarchy.           When Nemat dared to protest against the new regime, she was arrested and sent to the notorious Evin prison, where she would spend the next two-plus years, released just shy of 19 – alive, but deeply broken. From that traumatizing time, she says she learned “those of us who have experienced what the loss of basic rights looks and feels like have an obligation to speak up.”           Wai Hnin Pwint Thon was already four years old when she first met her father, Ko Mya Aye, a democratic activist who had been sent to prison for leading a peaceful protest against the military dictatorship in Burma (now known as Myanmar) in 1988.           Though at first she thought he was being treated well, the iron bars that prevented her from embracing her father soon jolted Wai Hnin to reality. In that moment, she says, a child became an aspiring voice for human rights, one who would speak out over the nearly three decades since that meeting – as her father was repeatedly imprisoned, most recently after the military’s February coup.            Wai Hnin, now living in exile, writes that her father’s “commitment to helping build a lasting democracy in Burma has taught me that an equal and just political system is not a guarantee. It requires hard work.”             Evan Mawarire never got to experience freedom in his country. By the time he turned three, Robert Mugabe had become Zimbabwe’s prime minister – and for the next 37 years, the dictator would run the country with the full weight of the government and military behind him, claiming that “only God” could remove him from power.            In 2016, Mawarire, now a pastor, concluded that the status quo in Zimbabwe could not stand. Corruption was rampant, deflation had replaced hyperinflation, and free and fair elections were long gone.            His decision to post a video, in which he draped himself in the country’s flag while giving an impassioned lament for the current state of Zimbabwe, was a huge risk. Still, Mawarire tells CNN, he got to the point where he realized “no one else is going to fight for this country with as much passion and commitment as I am.” He was later imprisoned for his political activism and, like Nemat and Wai Hnin, now lives in exile.            Mawarire, Nemat and Wai Hnin are among the 21st century’s freedom fighters – people who have risked their lives and liberty in a battle for democracy that is being fought globally. In this series, “Voices of Freedom,” 13 dissidents from around the world are telling their stories and making the case for supporters of democracy to fight for restoring and protecting the rights to speak freely and vote in honest elections. They are active participants in the Renew Democracy Initiative (RDI), a nonprofit dedicated to promoting democratic values at home and abroad.            The stakes could not be higher. Freedom House, a nonprofit research organization, put this battle in almost apocalyptic terms in its annual report on liberty. “As a lethal pandemic, economic and physical insecurity, and violent conflict ravaged the world in 2020, democracy’s defenders sustained heavy new losses in their struggle against authoritarian foes, shifting the international balance in favor of tyranny,” wrote Freedom House’s Sarah Repucci and Amy Slipowitz. “Incumbent leaders increasingly used force to crush opponents and settle scores, sometimes in the name of public health, while beleaguered activists—lacking effective international support—faced heavy jail sentences, torture, or murder in many settings.”           The organization labeled 2020 “the 15th consecutive year of decline in global freedom” and determined that less than 20% of the world’s population now lives in truly free countries. Among the countries where democracy is under assault is the world’s longest lived modern democratic government: the United States.            On Jan. 6, 2021, hundreds of insurrectionists stormed the citadel of US democracy – the Capitol – in an effort steal the 2020 presidential election from Joe Biden. For the first time in modern American history, a small but violent group of US citizens refused to accept the peaceful transfer of political power – and they showed how willing they were to go to extreme ends to try and keep then-President Donald Trump in office.            Five people died that day, including one Capitol Police officer. And, according to a Department of Justice filing, the rioters caused an estimated $1.5 million in damages to the Capitol building.            Though their efforts ultimately failed, the threat of another insurrection looms large over future US elections. A March poll from the Public Religion Research Institute and the Interfaith Youth Core found that 15% of Americans believe that “patriots may have to resort to violence in order to save our country.”            Equally alarming is that, according to a late summer CNN poll, 51% of Americans believe it’s “at least somewhat likely that an election in the next few years will be overturned by elected officials because their party lost.” When Americans do not have faith in the integrity of their elections, the impact worldwide can be devastating, says Gambian dissident Fatou Jaw Manneh.            As she has struggled to build a young democracy in her home country, Manneh writes, “it wasn’t just American influence that made me demand better from the Gambian government – it was knowing that America was there that made me believe that I could succeed.” Imperfect and as unequal as it may be, she says, the United States “is still the most potent global force for freedom, and without it the world… faces a dark future.”           Compounding problems, economic forces – including growing inequality – and the challenges of the Covid-19 pandemic have put new stress on nations struggling with the challenge of autocracy. China and Russia are among the nations that are seeking to demonstrate that their systems of governance can reward citizens with improved prosperity – and without the freedoms taken for granted in the west.            However, the Chinese government rejects the authoritarian label. In September, the Chinese Ambassador to the US, Qin Gang, gave a speech claiming China had a “whole-process democracy,” a system he said was built on the tenets of the Chinese constitution, which “prescribes that all power belongs to the people. The people have the right to election, and they can be broadly involved in national governance according to law.”            These words follow a familiar pattern from Chinese officials who, for years, have made misleading claims about the true nature of Beijing’s political system, Isaac Stone Fish, CEO of Strategy Risks, a China-focused research firm, explains to CNN. Though the Chinese government does hold elections, they are neither free nor fair nor representative of the will of the people, finds a 2021 Freedom House report, which also documented how Chinese President Xi Jinping used the pandemic to further expand his party’s surveillance of the Chinese people.           There is a point to this game of political semantics, says Stone Fish. It forces a debate within the US and other western democracies about something that should be obvious – that China’s government does not meet any internationally accepted definition of democracy. It also helps to distract from allegations of human rights abuses against ethnic minorities, censorship of the press and crackdowns on civil society (all of which the Chinese government denies).            But this debate does not negate a reality that many leaders of western democracies are acutely aware of – a growing dissatisfaction with their own form of government. At his first press conference in March of this year, US President Joe Biden remarked, “This is a battle between the utility of democracies in the 21st century and autocracies…We’ve got to prove democracy works.”            There is one feature all democracies share in common – they give power to the people, whether directly or through some form of elected representation. For activist and RDI chairman Garry Kasparov, who has been on the frontlines of battling Russian repression for over three decades, that’s a system worth fighting for – even if it comes at great cost.           He writes, “Hailing from the Soviet Union… a precursor to [President Vladimir] Putin’s Russia, I have always understood that democracy is a privilege – one that must constantly be defended.” Whether protesting the sentencing of Putin’s critics or taking to the streets of Moscow to demand free and fair elections, Kasparov, now living in exile, believes that democracy is an active sport that requires all of its citizens to participate.           Sheri Berman, a professor of political science at Barnard College, tells CNN that an active citizenry is a hallmark of democracy. She argues that strong democracies have robust civil societies capable of engaging in the kinds of collective action Kasparov initiated in Russia but was arrested for partaking in.            Simply put, citizens living in democracies should be able to express their dissent without risking retribution. And, Berman explains, they have multiple mechanisms to do so – whether by voting in elections in which two or more political parties are on the ballot, bringing lawsuits before an independent judiciary, writing or calling their elected leaders or taking to the streets in protest.           Beyond the political characteristics that define a democracy, there are the social and economic factors that are critical to its success, says Berman. A real democracy must provide some form of social equality to all of its citizens, regardless of gender, race, religion or ethnicity.            For Wai Hnin, social equality is one feature that has been sorely missing from Myanmar’s government, even as it instituted some democratic reforms prior to this year’s military coup.            The most obvious example is the horrendous treatment of the country’s Muslim minority, the Rohingya. In late 2016, the Burmese military began carrying out the “textbook example of ethnic cleansing” of the Rohingya, according to the United Nations human rights commissioner – driving hundreds of thousands of Rohingya survivors into neighboring Bangladesh. (The Burmese military has largely denied these allegations.)           Though Myanmar’s 2008 constitution forbids discrimination against any religious or ethnic minority, it also includes a section recognizing the “special position of Buddhism as the faith professed by the great majority of the citizens.” This ambiguity in the wording – combined with the power and influence of the Buddhist nationalists – has meant that minorities like the Rohingya have never been treated equally in civil society and have never had adequate representation in government under this constitution.           But just as important as social equality is economic equality, which – when secured – gives citizens the opportunity to focus on other pressing issues. Unfortunately, according to Thomas Carothers, senior vice president for studies at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace, over the last four years, economic inequality and stagnation have been driving factors of protests across the world – from Argentina to Egypt, France to India.            He and former Carnegie fellow David Wong write that this backlash is “a late-stage warning gong for capitalism,” arguing that public anger over various market failings, including the “dislocation and insecurity in the middle class” are behind the protests. And if democratic governments continue to let economic inequality grow, they will contribute to a growing sense that democracy cannot deliver for the people – leaving an opening for radical leaders to step in, Oliver Della Costa Stuenkel, associate professor of international relations at the Getúlio Vargas Foundation in São Paulo, explains to CNN.           In Brazil, Jair Bolsonaro, a far-right politician who might not have been competitive otherwise, was able to capitalize on the economic unrest in his successful bid for the presidency in 2018. As the country sunk deeper into a recession that began in 2014, and as a major corruption scandal plagued his predecessor’s administration, Bolsonaro positioned himself as a viable alternative. However, Stuenkel says, Bolsonaro did not necessarily win “because people thought he had better [economic] answers, but because part of the population didn’t have much to lose.”           Bolsonaro’s campaign was built on one of the biggest criticisms of western democracy today – that even though citizens may still freely vote for their elected leaders, many of those leaders are self-serving elites who are out of touch with the economic and social needs of those they supposedly serve. That logic, Stuenkel explains, “makes putting a radical who…lacks any qualification to govern a more appealing option.”           It goes far beyond Brazil. Across the world, far-right and far-left leaders have exploited people’s dissatisfaction with political elites and their maintenance of the status quo, Michael Abramowitz, President of Freedom House, tells CNN.           Hungary offers a powerful example. In the 2010 election, Hungarians voted overwhelmingly for Viktor Orbán’s Fidesz Party, kicking out the socialist government which had run the country for eight years. With unemployment creeping into the double digits and the economy contracting over the previous year, the conditions were ripe for Orbán to offer a different vision – one in which Hungarians could prosper.            And, according to several metrics, Orbán has addressed some of these dire economic realities. As of 2018, when he was elected for a third time, Hungary’s official unemployment figures and government debt had fallen, its credit rating had improved and its budget deficit had been approximately halved.           Any economic gains have not come without a high political price, though. Since Orbán became prime minister, he and his party have chipped away at Hungarian democracy, pushing through a series of significant constitutional and legislative changes that have expanded his control of many of the country’s independent institutions – including its judiciary.            More recently, his government “has moved to institute policies that hamper the operations of opposition groups, journalists, universities, and nongovernmental organizations (NGOs) who criticize it or whose perspectives it otherwise finds unfavorable,” says a Freedom House analysis. Though once a highly-rated democracy, according to the latest Freedom House rankings Hungary is now classified as partly free – and stands to drop further in the rankings if it continues on its current course.           Dissatisfaction with the status quo isn’t the only factor undermining democracies today. Abramowitz explains there have been dramatic changes in our “information environment.” In the early days of the internet and social media, activists were quite adept at using new information technologies to serve their democratic causes. But, in recent years, dictators and those who aspire to be them have learned how to use these technologies to serve their political agendas.            One recent example is Russian attempts to impact democratic elections abroad with digital disinformation campaigns. Steven Wilson, an assistant professor of politics at Brandeis University, writes that these digital campaigns – often run across social media platforms – “exploit existing political fault lines like race and regionalism to increase polarization and disaffection with the political system.” The consequence is an erosion of citizens’ trust in institutions and each other. And without trust, he argues, democracy cannot thrive.            One country where the impact of these kinds of campaigns has been felt is the United States. According to a declassified US intelligence report, Trump was Russian President Vladimir Putin’s pick for US president in 2016, and Russia used a two-part disinformation strategy to persuade the American public to vote against Hillary Clinton. As the report details, the Kremlin combined covert cyber intelligence operations targeting individuals and parties associated with the US presidential election, as well as overt efforts by Russian government agencies, third party intermediaries and paid digital trolls targeting American citizens.            And while Trump’s 2016 electoral victory cannot be entirely credited to Putin, it appears Russian efforts succeeded in both undermining some Americans’ faith in US democracy and in giving Putin a disinformation playbook he could apply “to future influence efforts in the United States and worldwide, including against US allies and their election processes,” according to the report.            Indeed, the US intelligence community assessed that Putin, although unsuccessful in swaying the election in Trump’s favor, tampered in the 2020 US presidential election. But the same assessment revealed an even more disturbing trend – Russia was not the only regime waging information warfare in the US. Iran, Venezuela and Cuba each tried to sway American public opinion during the same election cycle. (All countries deny meddling in US elections.)             According to Abramowitz, this is part of a dangerous pattern of copycat behavior among autocrats – learning worst practices from each other and using them to undermine trust in democracy.            This web of digital disinformation has only exacerbated Americans’ loss of faith in government and institutions, which had already been on the decline even before the 2016 election, according to the Pew Research Center. And while trust in government tends to be higher among the party which controls the US presidency, even in April of this year Pew shows that only 36% of Democrats and Democratic-leaning independents said they trusted in the US government. That number dropped dramatically to 9% among Republicans and Republican-leaning independents.            The clearest driver of distrust in US democracy is Trump’s lie that he really won the 2020 election. Despite any evidence of systematic voter fraud, Trump and his loyalists continue to sow doubt about Biden’s victory in the minds of the American people – at in-person rallies, through sham audits, in television appearances and in public statements. According to a CNN poll from August and early September 2021, they are achieving some degree of success. 36% of Americans – and a startling 78% of Republicans – now believe Biden did not win enough votes to be the legitimately elected president.            At the Oslo Freedom Forum in October, Venezuelan opposition leader Leopoldo López argued that the world did not have to settle for a dark future. Those who believe in the fundamentals of freedom could win the war against dictatorship – but they need to be united and organized, and  they require assistance from leading democracies like the United States.            This is no easy task. Hahrie Han, a professor of political science at Johns Hopkins University, explains to CNN that democracy is only as strong as people’s commitment to it, and that commitment has waned in recent years. However, civic institutions – from schools to houses of worship to social clubs – can play a key role in strengthening democracies at home and abroad.            Fundamentally, democracies demand that citizens accept they may not always get the electoral outcome that they want. Civic institutions, where people begin to encounter individuals and ideas they may disagree with, can teach the values of negotiation, compromise and even acceptance of a less than desirable outcome, she says.           Linda Chavez, a conservative political commentator and RDI board member, believes the most important civic institution may be schools. In the US, she tells CNN, many students have received a “comic book version of history with superheroes and supervillains,” but without a deeper understanding of the struggle to expand American democracy to more and more citizens.            It’s no surprise, Chavez says, that low voter turnout has become a defining feature of the 18 to 29-year-old demographic in the US (though 2020 did see an eight point rise in voter turnout among this cohort). If students spend time reading through the original documents that shaped American democracy – from the Federalist Papers to the US Constitution to the 1964 Civil Rights Act – Chavez reasons that students will not simply bemoan how unequal the US has historically been, but take pride in the multi-century struggle Americans have endured to expand civil rights and liberties. And perhaps they will feel more motivated to take part in that democratic struggle moving forward.            While civic education is a critical piece of the democratic puzzle, there are additional efforts that must be taken to strengthen US commitment to democracy. And one of them must target the many Americans who have come to believe Trump’s election lies.            Chavez says that conservatives must lead that effort. “The Constitution – which conservatives have always claimed to owe allegiance to – is under attack. Trump’s tenure was marked by his flouting of the rule of law and separation of powers, and now he is being aided by those who previously claimed to [be] champions of those very principles,” she writes to CNN. Chavez hopes that Republicans like Rep. Liz Cheney of Wyoming, though in the minority, can serve as models for speaking truth to Trump and his allies’ dangerous assertions of power.           Beyond outreach to disbelieving Republicans, Ruth Ben-Ghiat, a professor of history and Italian studies at New York University, tells CNN that democratic activists must tap into the American population which does not vote or participate in the political process at all.           In the 2020 US presidential election, which saw record voter turnout, about 80 million eligible voters still stayed home. According to 2020 US Census data, there are several reasons people cite for not voting, but chief among them is feeling disinterested in the political process. A 2020 Medill/NPR/Ipsos poll supports the census findings – almost a quarter of nonvoters said they were uninterested in politics and almost a third of nonvoters said they had not even registered to vote. According to a NPR analysis of this poll, these nonvoters “are disengaged, disaffected and don’t believe politics can make a difference in their lives.”           Ben-Ghiat explains that voter registration and mobilization efforts must target these potential voters – and must do a more effective job at explaining how their votes can translate into concrete actions by elected representatives.            Carothers says one way to plead this case is to show proof of concept. When Congress and the White House are able to work together to solve pressing issues facing the American public – such as economic inequality or aging infrastructure – they can argue that a system of governance, often plagued by gridlock, can also be a force for good in people’s day-to-day lives.            And while this may seem an impossible task against the backdrop of America’s fractured politics, it is urgent that the nation’s elected leaders and citizens model the kind of behavior befitting a democracy. After the events of Jan. 6, RDI began hearing from activists and dissidents about the need for the US to quickly change course and set a worldwide example for true freedom. They wanted to “remind us of the importance of America’s founding values to our own success and to the global community as a whole,” Uriel Epshtein, Executive Director of RDI, tells CNN.            In response, RDI launched the Frontlines of Freedom project. It features an open letter, signed by 52 dissidents from 28 countries, in which they argue, “If the world’s leading democracy doesn’t believe in its own values, why should dictators even bother paying lip service to them? We must defend these principles that inspire advocates of liberty and provide a crucial check on tyrants.”            Beyond a firm commitment to secure voting rights and uphold democratic election results, those principles include protecting free speech and free press rights. As the signatories explain, we cannot defeat “illiberalism with illiberalism,” but rather with the creation of a space where ideas and opinions, however controversial or provocative, may be shared and debated.            As democratic legislative bodies debate the parameters of these freedoms, they can still invest time and resources in strengthening civil society. And while a robust civil society is critical to the maintenance of democracies, it is perhaps even more critical in countries where activists are trying to lay the foundations of democracy.            For example, retired Lt. Col. Alexander Vindman, a whistleblower during the Trump administration, and Belarussian dissident Andrei Sannikov write that for Belarus to succeed in moving away from an autocracy that has governed its country for over 25 years, it “will require the collective action of other western nations committed to the values and principles of basic human rights and freedoms.” The United States could take lead on this by “providing material and ideological support to the country’s pro-democracy elements.”            This kind of aid is far more practical, explains Roland Rich, an assistant teaching professor at Rutgers University and former Australian diplomat. Government-to-government aid, especially when one of the parties involved is not a democracy, is often highly ineffective in bringing about tangible change. However, he argues, “people-to-people aid” can empower citizens and civil society to organize and push for the freedoms they deserve.     Sign up for our new newsletter.Join us on Twitter and Facebook         For Mawarire, who continues the struggle for democracy in Zimbabwe, Rich’s thinking mirrors his mobilization efforts on the ground. He explains that one of his country’s democratic slogans has become, “If we cannot cause the politician to change, then we must inspire the citizen to be bold.”           And while international support for democratic efforts can often play a critical role, Mawarire believes that much of the push for freedom must come from within countries where citizens are struggling against the weight of autocracy. The beauty of his advocacy work, he says, is helping fellow Zimbabweans recognize their agency in the political process and then driving them to say, “I’m not going to sit in the terraces or bleachers to watch other people [build democracy]. I’m doing it myself.”           Democracy does not blossom overnight. Mawarire compares it to growing a garden and waiting patiently for the seeds of freedom to blossom. It may take time, but “there’s going to be a generation that’s going to harvest the fruits of democracy,” he says. Until then, all those who believe in the values of a free and open society must tend to the garden, watering, cultivating, and, when necessary, removing the weeds of autocracy that threaten to compromise its growth.

They are active participants in the Renew Democracy Initiative (RDI), a nonprofit dedicated to promoting democratic values at home and abroad.            The stakes could not be higher. Freedom House, a nonprofit research organization, put this battle in almost apocalyptic terms in its annual report on liberty. “As a lethal pandemic, economic and physical insecurity, and violent conflict ravaged the world in 2020, democracy’s defenders sustained heavy new losses in their struggle against authoritarian foes, shifting the international balance in favor of tyranny,” wrote Freedom House’s Sarah Repucci and Amy Slipowitz. “Incumbent leaders increasingly used force to crush opponents and settle scores, sometimes in the name of public health, while beleaguered activists—lacking effective international support—faced heavy jail sentences, torture, or murder in many settings.”           The organization labeled 2020 “the 15th consecutive year of decline in global freedom” and determined that less than 20% of the world’s population now lives in truly free countries. Among the countries where democracy is under assault is the world’s longest lived modern democratic government: the United States.            On Jan. 6, 2021, hundreds of insurrectionists stormed the citadel of US democracy – the Capitol – in an effort steal the 2020 presidential election from Joe Biden. For the first time in modern American history, a small but violent group of US citizens refused to accept the peaceful transfer of political power – and they showed how willing they were to go to extreme ends to try and keep then-President Donald Trump in office.            Five people died that day, including one Capitol Police officer. And, according to a Department of Justice filing, the rioters caused an estimated $1.5 million in damages to the Capitol building.            Though their efforts ultimately failed, the threat of another insurrection looms large over future US elections. A March poll from the Public Religion Research Institute and the Interfaith Youth Core found that 15% of Americans believe that “patriots may have to resort to violence in order to save our country.”            Equally alarming is that, according to a late summer CNN poll, 51% of Americans believe it’s “at least somewhat likely that an election in the next few years will be overturned by elected officials because their party lost.” When Americans do not have faith in the integrity of their elections, the impact worldwide can be devastating, says Gambian dissident Fatou Jaw Manneh.            As she has struggled to build a young democracy in her home country, Manneh writes, “it wasn’t just American influence that made me demand better from the Gambian government – it was knowing that America was there that made me believe that I could succeed.” Imperfect and as unequal as it may be, she says, the United States “is still the most potent global force for freedom, and without it the world… faces a dark future.”           Compounding problems, economic forces – including growing inequality – and the challenges of the Covid-19 pandemic have put new stress on nations struggling with the challenge of autocracy. China and Russia are among the nations that are seeking to demonstrate that their systems of governance can reward citizens with improved prosperity – and without the freedoms taken for granted in the west.            However, the Chinese government rejects the authoritarian label. In September, the Chinese Ambassador to the US, Qin Gang, gave a speech claiming China had a “whole-process democracy,” a system he said was built on the tenets of the Chinese constitution, which “prescribes that all power belongs to the people. The people have the right to election, and they can be broadly involved in national governance according to law.”            These words follow a familiar pattern from Chinese officials who, for years, have made misleading claims about the true nature of Beijing’s political system, Isaac Stone Fish, CEO of Strategy Risks, a China-focused research firm, explains to CNN. Though the Chinese government does hold elections, they are neither free nor fair nor representative of the will of the people, finds a 2021 Freedom House report, which also documented how Chinese President Xi Jinping used the pandemic to further expand his party’s surveillance of the Chinese people.           There is a point to this game of political semantics, says Stone Fish. It forces a debate within the US and other western democracies about something that should be obvious – that China’s government does not meet any internationally accepted definition of democracy. It also helps to distract from allegations of human rights abuses against ethnic minorities, censorship of the press and crackdowns on civil society (all of which the Chinese government denies).            But this debate does not negate a reality that many leaders of western democracies are acutely aware of – a growing dissatisfaction with their own form of government. At his first press conference in March of this year, US President Joe Biden remarked, “This is a battle between the utility of democracies in the 21st century and autocracies…We’ve got to prove democracy works.”            There is one feature all democracies share in common – they give power to the people, whether directly or through some form of elected representation. For activist and RDI chairman Garry Kasparov, who has been on the frontlines of battling Russian repression for over three decades, that’s a system worth fighting for – even if it comes at great cost.           He writes, “Hailing from the Soviet Union… a precursor to [President Vladimir] Putin’s Russia, I have always understood that democracy is a privilege – one that must constantly be defended.” Whether protesting the sentencing of Putin’s critics or taking to the streets of Moscow to demand free and fair elections, Kasparov, now living in exile, believes that democracy is an active sport that requires all of its citizens to participate.           Sheri Berman, a professor of political science at Barnard College, tells CNN that an active citizenry is a hallmark of democracy. She argues that strong democracies have robust civil societies capable of engaging in the kinds of collective action Kasparov initiated in Russia but was arrested for partaking in.            Simply put, citizens living in democracies should be able to express their dissent without risking retribution. And, Berman explains, they have multiple mechanisms to do so – whether by voting in elections in which two or more political parties are on the ballot, bringing lawsuits before an independent judiciary, writing or calling their elected leaders or taking to the streets in protest.           Beyond the political characteristics that define a democracy, there are the social and economic factors that are critical to its success, says Berman. A real democracy must provide some form of social equality to all of its citizens, regardless of gender, race, religion or ethnicity.            For Wai Hnin, social equality is one feature that has been sorely missing from Myanmar’s government, even as it instituted some democratic reforms prior to this year’s military coup.            The most obvious example is the horrendous treatment of the country’s Muslim minority, the Rohingya. In late 2016, the Burmese military began carrying out the “textbook example of ethnic cleansing” of the Rohingya, according to the United Nations human rights commissioner – driving hundreds of thousands of Rohingya survivors into neighboring Bangladesh. (The Burmese military has largely denied these allegations.)           Though Myanmar’s 2008 constitution forbids discrimination against any religious or ethnic minority, it also includes a section recognizing the “special position of Buddhism as the faith professed by the great majority of the citizens.” This ambiguity in the wording – combined with the power and influence of the Buddhist nationalists – has meant that minorities like the Rohingya have never been treated equally in civil society and have never had adequate representation in government under this constitution.           But just as important as social equality is economic equality, which – when secured – gives citizens the opportunity to focus on other pressing issues. Unfortunately, according to Thomas Carothers, senior vice president for studies at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace, over the last four years, economic inequality and stagnation have been driving factors of protests across the world – from Argentina to Egypt, France to India.            He and former Carnegie fellow David Wong write that this backlash is “a late-stage warning gong for capitalism,” arguing that public anger over various market failings, including the “dislocation and insecurity in the middle class” are behind the protests. And if democratic governments continue to let economic inequality grow, they will contribute to a growing sense that democracy cannot deliver for the people – leaving an opening for radical leaders to step in, Oliver Della Costa Stuenkel, associate professor of international relations at the Getúlio Vargas Foundation in São Paulo, explains to CNN.           In Brazil, Jair Bolsonaro, a far-right politician who might not have been competitive otherwise, was able to capitalize on the economic unrest in his successful bid for the presidency in 2018. As the country sunk deeper into a recession that began in 2014, and as a major corruption scandal plagued his predecessor’s administration, Bolsonaro positioned himself as a viable alternative. However, Stuenkel says, Bolsonaro did not necessarily win “because people thought he had better [economic] answers, but because part of the population didn’t have much to lose.”           Bolsonaro’s campaign was built on one of the biggest criticisms of western democracy today – that even though citizens may still freely vote for their elected leaders, many of those leaders are self-serving elites who are out of touch with the economic and social needs of those they supposedly serve. That logic, Stuenkel explains, “makes putting a radical who…lacks any qualification to govern a more appealing option.”           It goes far beyond Brazil. Across the world, far-right and far-left leaders have exploited people’s dissatisfaction with political elites and their maintenance of the status quo, Michael Abramowitz, President of Freedom House, tells CNN.           Hungary offers a powerful example. In the 2010 election, Hungarians voted overwhelmingly for Viktor Orbán’s Fidesz Party, kicking out the socialist government which had run the country for eight years. With unemployment creeping into the double digits and the economy contracting over the previous year, the conditions were ripe for Orbán to offer a different vision – one in which Hungarians could prosper.            And, according to several metrics, Orbán has addressed some of these dire economic realities. As of 2018, when he was elected for a third time, Hungary’s official unemployment figures and government debt had fallen, its credit rating had improved and its budget deficit had been approximately halved.           Any economic gains have not come without a high political price, though. Since Orbán became prime minister, he and his party have chipped away at Hungarian democracy, pushing through a series of significant constitutional and legislative changes that have expanded his control of many of the country’s independent institutions – including its judiciary.            More recently, his government “has moved to institute policies that hamper the operations of opposition groups, journalists, universities, and nongovernmental organizations (NGOs) who criticize it or whose perspectives it otherwise finds unfavorable,” says a Freedom House analysis. Though once a highly-rated democracy, according to the latest Freedom House rankings Hungary is now classified as partly free – and stands to drop further in the rankings if it continues on its current course.           Dissatisfaction with the status quo isn’t the only factor undermining democracies today. Abramowitz explains there have been dramatic changes in our “information environment.” In the early days of the internet and social media, activists were quite adept at using new information technologies to serve their democratic causes. But, in recent years, dictators and those who aspire to be them have learned how to use these technologies to serve their political agendas.            One recent example is Russian attempts to impact democratic elections abroad with digital disinformation campaigns. Steven Wilson, an assistant professor of politics at Brandeis University, writes that these digital campaigns – often run across social media platforms – “exploit existing political fault lines like race and regionalism to increase polarization and disaffection with the political system.” The consequence is an erosion of citizens’ trust in institutions and each other. And without trust, he argues, democracy cannot thrive.            One country where the impact of these kinds of campaigns has been felt is the United States. According to a declassified US intelligence report, Trump was Russian President Vladimir Putin’s pick for US president in 2016, and Russia used a two-part disinformation strategy to persuade the American public to vote against Hillary Clinton. As the report details, the Kremlin combined covert cyber intelligence operations targeting individuals and parties associated with the US presidential election, as well as overt efforts by Russian government agencies, third party intermediaries and paid digital trolls targeting American citizens.            And while Trump’s 2016 electoral victory cannot be entirely credited to Putin, it appears Russian efforts succeeded in both undermining some Americans’ faith in US democracy and in giving Putin a disinformation playbook he could apply “to future influence efforts in the United States and worldwide, including against US allies and their election processes,” according to the report.            Indeed, the US intelligence community assessed that Putin, although unsuccessful in swaying the election in Trump’s favor, tampered in the 2020 US presidential election. But the same assessment revealed an even more disturbing trend – Russia was not the only regime waging information warfare in the US. Iran, Venezuela and Cuba each tried to sway American public opinion during the same election cycle. (All countries deny meddling in US elections.)             According to Abramowitz, this is part of a dangerous pattern of copycat behavior among autocrats – learning worst practices from each other and using them to undermine trust in democracy.            This web of digital disinformation has only exacerbated Americans’ loss of faith in government and institutions, which had already been on the decline even before the 2016 election, according to the Pew Research Center. And while trust in government tends to be higher among the party which controls the US presidency, even in April of this year Pew shows that only 36% of Democrats and Democratic-leaning independents said they trusted in the US government. That number dropped dramatically to 9% among Republicans and Republican-leaning independents.            The clearest driver of distrust in US democracy is Trump’s lie that he really won the 2020 election. Despite any evidence of systematic voter fraud, Trump and his loyalists continue to sow doubt about Biden’s victory in the minds of the American people – at in-person rallies, through sham audits, in television appearances and in public statements. According to a CNN poll from August and early September 2021, they are achieving some degree of success. 36% of Americans – and a startling 78% of Republicans – now believe Biden did not win enough votes to be the legitimately elected president.            At the Oslo Freedom Forum in October, Venezuelan opposition leader Leopoldo López argued that the world did not have to settle for a dark future. Those who believe in the fundamentals of freedom could win the war against dictatorship – but they need to be united and organized, and  they require assistance from leading democracies like the United States.            This is no easy task. Hahrie Han, a professor of political science at Johns Hopkins University, explains to CNN that democracy is only as strong as people’s commitment to it, and that commitment has waned in recent years. However, civic institutions – from schools to houses of worship to social clubs – can play a key role in strengthening democracies at home and abroad.            Fundamentally, democracies demand that citizens accept they may not always get the electoral outcome that they want. Civic institutions, where people begin to encounter individuals and ideas they may disagree with, can teach the values of negotiation, compromise and even acceptance of a less than desirable outcome, she says.           Linda Chavez, a conservative political commentator and RDI board member, believes the most important civic institution may be schools. In the US, she tells CNN, many students have received a “comic book version of history with superheroes and supervillains,” but without a deeper understanding of the struggle to expand American democracy to more and more citizens.            It’s no surprise, Chavez says, that low voter turnout has become a defining feature of the 18 to 29-year-old demographic in the US (though 2020 did see an eight point rise in voter turnout among this cohort). If students spend time reading through the original documents that shaped American democracy – from the Federalist Papers to the US Constitution to the 1964 Civil Rights Act – Chavez reasons that students will not simply bemoan how unequal the US has historically been, but take pride in the multi-century struggle Americans have endured to expand civil rights and liberties. And perhaps they will feel more motivated to take part in that democratic struggle moving forward.            While civic education is a critical piece of the democratic puzzle, there are additional efforts that must be taken to strengthen US commitment to democracy. And one of them must target the many Americans who have come to believe Trump’s election lies.            Chavez says that conservatives must lead that effort. “The Constitution – which conservatives have always claimed to owe allegiance to – is under attack. Trump’s tenure was marked by his flouting of the rule of law and separation of powers, and now he is being aided by those who previously claimed to [be] champions of those very principles,” she writes to CNN. Chavez hopes that Republicans like Rep. Liz Cheney of Wyoming, though in the minority, can serve as models for speaking truth to Trump and his allies’ dangerous assertions of power.           Beyond outreach to disbelieving Republicans, Ruth Ben-Ghiat, a professor of history and Italian studies at New York University, tells CNN that democratic activists must tap into the American population which does not vote or participate in the political process at all.           In the 2020 US presidential election, which saw record voter turnout, about 80 million eligible voters still stayed home. According to 2020 US Census data, there are several reasons people cite for not voting, but chief among them is feeling disinterested in the political process. A 2020 Medill/NPR/Ipsos poll supports the census findings – almost a quarter of nonvoters said they were uninterested in politics and almost a third of nonvoters said they had not even registered to vote. According to a NPR analysis of this poll, these nonvoters “are disengaged, disaffected and don’t believe politics can make a difference in their lives.”           Ben-Ghiat explains that voter registration and mobilization efforts must target these potential voters – and must do a more effective job at explaining how their votes can translate into concrete actions by elected representatives.            Carothers says one way to plead this case is to show proof of concept. When Congress and the White House are able to work together to solve pressing issues facing the American public – such as economic inequality or aging infrastructure – they can argue that a system of governance, often plagued by gridlock, can also be a force for good in people’s day-to-day lives.            And while this may seem an impossible task against the backdrop of America’s fractured politics, it is urgent that the nation’s elected leaders and citizens model the kind of behavior befitting a democracy. After the events of Jan. 6, RDI began hearing from activists and dissidents about the need for the US to quickly change course and set a worldwide example for true freedom. They wanted to “remind us of the importance of America’s founding values to our own success and to the global community as a whole,” Uriel Epshtein, Executive Director of RDI, tells CNN.            In response, RDI launched the Frontlines of Freedom project. It features an open letter, signed by 52 dissidents from 28 countries, in which they argue, “If the world’s leading democracy doesn’t believe in its own values, why should dictators even bother paying lip service to them? We must defend these principles that inspire advocates of liberty and provide a crucial check on tyrants.”            Beyond a firm commitment to secure voting rights and uphold democratic election results, those principles include protecting free speech and free press rights. As the signatories explain, we cannot defeat “illiberalism with illiberalism,” but rather with the creation of a space where ideas and opinions, however controversial or provocative, may be shared and debated.            As democratic legislative bodies debate the parameters of these freedoms, they can still invest time and resources in strengthening civil society. And while a robust civil society is critical to the maintenance of democracies, it is perhaps even more critical in countries where activists are trying to lay the foundations of democracy.            For example, retired Lt. Col. Alexander Vindman, a whistleblower during the Trump administration, and Belarussian dissident Andrei Sannikov write that for Belarus to succeed in moving away from an autocracy that has governed its country for over 25 years, it “will require the collective action of other western nations committed to the values and principles of basic human rights and freedoms.” The United States could take lead on this by “providing material and ideological support to the country’s pro-democracy elements.”            This kind of aid is far more practical, explains Roland Rich, an assistant teaching professor at Rutgers University and former Australian diplomat. Government-to-government aid, especially when one of the parties involved is not a democracy, is often highly ineffective in bringing about tangible change. However, he argues, “people-to-people aid” can empower citizens and civil society to organize and push for the freedoms they deserve.     Sign up for our new newsletter.Join us on Twitter and Facebook         For Mawarire, who continues the struggle for democracy in Zimbabwe, Rich’s thinking mirrors his mobilization efforts on the ground. He explains that one of his country’s democratic slogans has become, “If we cannot cause the politician to change, then we must inspire the citizen to be bold.”           And while international support for democratic efforts can often play a critical role, Mawarire believes that much of the push for freedom must come from within countries where citizens are struggling against the weight of autocracy. The beauty of his advocacy work, he says, is helping fellow Zimbabweans recognize their agency in the political process and then driving them to say, “I’m not going to sit in the terraces or bleachers to watch other people [build democracy]. I’m doing it myself.”           Democracy does not blossom overnight. Mawarire compares it to growing a garden and waiting patiently for the seeds of freedom to blossom. It may take time, but “there’s going to be a generation that’s going to harvest the fruits of democracy,” he says. Until then, all those who believe in the values of a free and open society must tend to the garden, watering, cultivating, and, when necessary, removing the weeds of autocracy that threaten to compromise its growth.

Wai Hnin is also a fellow of the Renew Democracy Initiative’s Frontlines of Freedom project. The views expressed in this commentary are her own. View more opinion on CNN.         I was 4 years old when my mom took me to meet my dad for the first time. I thought we were traveling to a park or a playground, but then we arrived outside Insein prison in Rangoon (present day Yangon), Burma, and I was even more impressed. It was a massive compound with an imposing red entrance and more guards than I could count.            “Is daddy very wealthy?,” I asked. My mom told me to keep quiet and stay close to her. Men in uniform drilled her with questions, while other guards rummaged through the gifts that we had brought for my dad.            After waiting for hours in the scorching sun, we were finally allowed into a room where we met a man dressed in all white, and in handcuffs and shackles. I recognized him instantly – this was my father whose photo had hung on a glass cabinet in my house for as far back as I could remember. His wild hair from the photo wasn’t so wild anymore, but he still had that friendly smile on his face. I wanted to hug him, even though there were iron bars between us. I reached out my fingers so I could at least touch his hand.            Although this first meeting happened almost three decades ago, I can so clearly remember it. That was the day I realized that my dad was a prisoner being kept by these guards. And those “gifts” that we brought for him? They were essential food and medicine, which he needed to stay alive behind these foreboding concrete walls.           My father was first sent to prison for leading a peaceful protest against the Burmese military dictatorship in 1988. He was among thousands of students who marched on the street calling for democracy, human rights and freedom in my country. Since then, he has been in and out of prison for continuing to protest military rule and advocating for human rights.             But his commitment to helping build a lasting democracy in Burma has taught me that an equal and just political system is not a guarantee. It requires hard work, and it could come with serious consequences – not just for my family or country but for the world at large.           Following my first meeting with my father, I began to study the history of Burma. I learned that it had been under an oppressive military dictatorship since 1962. I also read how the military ruthlessly killed many peaceful protesters during the 1988 uprising and how they imprisoned thousands of civilians for simply believing in democracy and freedom. Though military regimes have come and gone since then, the military today – though it denies its brutality – continues to commit atrocities with impunity, according to the United Nations Deputy High Commissioner for Human Rights.            The more I learned, the more certain I was that I needed to follow in my father’s footsteps. Though my father urged me to choose a different path, I refused to heed his warnings.            I thought I might pursue teaching, since I believed education could play a crucial role in driving social change and empowering young people to fight for their rights. But because of my father’s political activities, I was denied entrance into any Burmese university. And so, in 2007, I arrived in the United Kingdom to study international relations. That same year, my father was arrested a second time for leading another peaceful protest. Even though I was thousands of miles away, I started campaigning for the release of all political prisoners in Burma – including my father.      Your rights could be taken away rapidly. I know because it happened to me         But what I had not fully anticipated was the consequence I would face from the Burmese government. Having used my voice abroad, I could no longer return home without facing the possibility of arrest. I subsequently became a political dissident in exile.             In 2008, caving to a combination of internal and external pressures, the Burmese military regime drafted a new constitution, which while safeguarding much of their power, offered limited democratic and social reforms. Two years later, they released Aung San Suu Kyi, an opposition leader who had spent nearly 15 years in detention, and allowed her to stand for elections in April 2012.           For the United States and much of the international community, Suu Kyi’s freedom – and her party’s sweeping electoral victory in 2015 – marked a significant milestone in my country’s journey toward democracy. But it did not fully capture the subtle and not so subtle ways that the military continued to hold a tight grip on Burma.           While the new constitution and Suu Kyi’s government provided a wider space for civil society – and greater access to tools like social media and the internet – the military still had guaranteed ministerial posts and appointed a quarter of MPs in the parliament. And while many of these social reforms were enacted in cities, the military was continuing to torture, rape and kill ethnic civilians in more rural areas, according to an independent report requested by the UN Human Rights Council.       What I learned about freedom from a 2x2 Venezuelan prison cell         Despite warnings from human rights activists like me that the reform process in Burma was designed to keep the military in power, the international community largely ignored our concerns. Meanwhile, many activists in Burma who spoke out against the military and demanded genuine democracy were arrested and thrown in prison.            In late 2016, when the military began perpetrating what the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights referred to as a “textbook example of ethnic cleansing” against the Rohingya, a Muslim minority, it seemed like things might be reaching a breaking point.            Finally, we thought, the international community would wake up to the atrocities being committed in Burma and come to our aid. Except this aid largely took the form of sanctioning a few Burmese military generals, freezing their assets and banning them from traveling to the US.            It’s no wonder Min Aung Hlaing, the head of the Burmese military, calculated that he could get away with staging a coup in February. The same day the coup began and Suu Kyi was arrested on trumped up charges, the military came for my father, who had most recently been released from prison in 2012. As a prominent democracy advocate, the military undoubtedly considered my father a troublemaker, and they arrested him before he could mobilize any anti-coup movement.      Our deepest fear for America -- and the world         But it wasn’t just him. Many others were taken from their homes across Burma to prisons they may never leave. I am heartbroken for my father, but I cannot stop thinking about the other children now condemned to go through what I went through – not knowing where their parents are or when they will see them again.            I am encouraged to see that when the coup began, the US government took immediate action against the Burmese military by imposing targeted sanctions. But we need more. The US and the greater international community need to use all the tools at their disposal – diplomatic, humanitarian, economic and legal – to help people in Burma.            Activists inside and outside the country have been calling for a global arms embargo to stop the flow of weapons to the military, additional sanctions on gas revenues that help fund the Burmese military, and support for efforts to report the military’s violent actions to the International Criminal Court.      Sign up for our new newsletter.Join us on Twitter and Facebook         Though I do not know when my father will be released from prison this time, or when I will be able to go home safely, I will continue to speak out against the military and amplify the voices of people in Burma who have been oppressed by the brutal military regime. Yes, the Burmese military denies this oppression and says it’s part of its fight against terrorism, but the truth is that we are being persecuted.           Despite the ongoing use of violence, I refuse to believe the Burmese military has won. People like my father and many others like him continue to risk our lives for the sake of freedom. And with the aid of the US and the rest of the free world, we might just have a chance to help the people of Burma achieve true democracy.    © 2023 Cable News Network. A Warner Bros.

I was 13 years old when the Islamic Revolution toppled the Iranian government in 1979. Though I was a Christian living in a largely Muslim country, I had never felt discrimination because of my faith.           My grandmothers had escaped the 1917 Russian Revolution and fled to Iran in search of freedom. And to a certain extent, they had found it. My father had become a successful ballroom dancing instructor in Tehran and taught Muslim couples the cha-cha and the tango. My mother was a hairdresser who styled fashionable Muslim women’s hair. And I had grown up wearing bikinis on the shores of the Caspian Sea, while partying with my Muslim friends.            The revolutionary leaders promised to expand social freedoms, grant political ones and build a democracy. They used our grievances against Mohammad Reza Shah Pahlavi, the Shah of Iran, to win our trust and gain power. But as soon as they assumed office, the few personal liberties we had enjoyed vanished and a strict Islamic law was put in place.            In less than a year, women’s rights to self-expression were stripped away: dancing, singing, holding our boyfriends’ hands in public and wearing bikinis all became largely forbidden activities. A few priests from my Roman Catholic Church, all of whom were foreign nationals who had lived in Iran for years, were deported, and several of the properties that belonged to the church were confiscated.      I was born in a Chinese 'reeducation camp.' I'm watching history repeat itself         The irony was that a few of my Christian relatives had trusted Ayatollah Khomeini, the Islamic revolutionary leader, and celebrated when the Shah was forced into exile. Now, they, like me, were paying the price.           Though Iran’s transition from a nation of limited social rights to one of virtually none may seem like a distant reality to those living under democracy, the truth is that it is not.           If Western democracies are not on guard, their citizens can fall prey to the same kinds of leaders who now control Iran’s political infrastructure. The revolutionary leaders were populists who promised to return power to the people after decades of monarchical rule, and for many disenfranchised voters in democracies who feel their elected officials have ignored their struggles, the populist messaging can have quite a strong appeal – even if it is just a ploy.            But the risk is not only in losing civil or democratic rights, but in being punished for challenging the authority figures who have stripped citizens of those rights.            After 1979, our accomplished teachers were replaced by fanatical young academics, many of whom were members of the newly formed Iranian Revolutionary Guard. They spent class time spreading the government’s propaganda and trying to persuade us that the regime’s fanatical rules – like forcing all women and girls over age 9 to wear the hijab – were for our own good. They argued that we had to dress modestly so that we would not attract unwanted attention from men.            At the time, I told our principal that I was a Christian, so the new Islamic rules of modesty should not apply to me. She responded, “You believe in the wrong religion.” I was politically naïve, but I was also aggrieved, having experienced firsthand why freedom of religion mattered. I attended protest rallies to express my frustration with the new religious laws that limited or attacked the rights of Iranian women.           Speaking out against the regime, in any shape or form, was now considered an act of war against God – the penalty for which could be death. And, in January 1982, the Revolutionary Guard arrested me for doing just that. At only 16, I had been accused of being an anti-revolutionary and sent to the notorious Evin prison. I was tortured, physically and emotionally, and then I was forced to marry one of my interrogators, who was assassinated 15 months after the marriage.      The fiercest fight of the 21st century -- to save democracy         Six months after his death – and two years, two months and 12 days after my initial arrest – I was released. My captors had decided that there was no reason to keep me any longer, perhaps because they had succeeded in destroying my spirit and suppressing my desire to protest. Many of my friends and cellmates had been executed while I was in prison, and I was suffering from post-traumatic stress disorder – not that I knew it at the time. I was just shy of 19 years of age when I was released.           Though it took me several years – and a move to Canada – before I shared the details of my tragic story, I determined to do so because a democracy is only as good as its citizens. Now, living in the West, I have become acutely aware that even the strongest democracies are not immune to demagogues parading as populists. Those of us who have experienced what the loss of basic rights looks and feels like have an obligation to speak up. Because once the demagogues – or aspiring ones –  have assumed control, it will be too late.           Indeed, democracy is like water caught in the palm of our hands. If we do not focus on holding onto it, the water will drip away through our fingers, and we will be left with nothing but a burning thirst.

The Islamic Republic of Iran masquerades as a democracy, holding elections for its parliament and president. Yet, its Supreme Leader, Ayatollah Khamenei, who replaced Ayatollah Khomeini after his death, and his Guardian Council decide who is or is not fit to run in elections.            And it certainly does not have a thriving free press or civil society. Anyone who criticizes the regime and its officials can be arrested and even condemned to death.            The line that separates democracy from tyranny is not as thick as Westerners might choose to believe. In Iran, we believed that our good will, selfless efforts and desire for better governance could not possibly be manipulated and destroyed. Many of us even died during the revolution to bring the Islamic Republic into existence. But we were wrong, and we have been paying the price for close to half a century.    © 2023 Cable News Network. A Warner Bros. Discovery Company. All Rights Reserved.

opinion,What I learned about freedom from a 2x2 Venezuelan prison cell,https://www.cnn.com/2021/11/11/opinions/venezuela-democracy-loss-freedom-lesson-lopez/index.html," Editor’s Note: Leopoldo López is a Venezuelan politician and opposition leader who was imprisoned on charges of inciting anti-government protests. He is a fellow of the Renew Democracy Initiative’s Frontlines of Freedom project. The opinions expressed in this commentary are those of the author. View more opinion articles on CNN.         For many people, freedom is an abstract concept. It’s like breathing; you don’t think about it until you are gasping for air.           The same thing happens with democracy. Too many voters take it for granted, until the moment they realize it’s entirely possible to have an election without democracy – just like in Cuba, Russia, Iran, and my home country of Venezuela.           This became painfully clear to me while I was imprisoned for political opposition to President Nicolás Maduro’s dictatorship. In a 2x2 meter cell with a lock the size of a brick, I learned what freedom was when I didn’t have it.           The Venezuela I was born into in the 1970s was considered the envy of the Americas: a country with a strong economy capable of providing prosperity and opportunities to almost everybody. Venezuelan leaders had successfully built this regime of freedom after the downfall of Marcos Pérez Jiménez’s military dictatorship in 1958. Between the 1960s and 1990s, Venezuela was “the democratic exception” in Latin America, a title that every Venezuelan carried with pride.           My country had some of the best public services of the region during that time – including a prestigious network of schools and universities and a health care system that helped eradicate malaria in parts of the country in 1961, as certified by the World Health Organization (WHO), a status Venezuela has since lost. This was an era when many Europeans and Latin Americans alike wanted to emigrate to Venezuela for a better life.     The fiercest fight of the 21st century -- to save democracy         Now, 22 years after Hugo Chávez’s presidency began and nearly a decade after Maduro seized power in what I believe was a fraudulent 2013 presidential election, Venezuela is undergoing the worst multilayered crisis in the continent. Poverty, violence, starvation, and shortages of crucial supplies are the new normal. A 2016 survey found that almost three-quarters of the population involuntarily lost an average of 19 pounds, with emergency rooms overwhelmed by cases of severely malnourished children.            Hospitals lack the equipment and medicine they need to function, leaving families across the country at risk of dying without access to treatment – a situation aggravated by the Covid-19 pandemic. Over 6 million Venezuelans have fled the country, many for fear of persecution or lack of economic opportunities.            How did we turn from being an island of democracy to a broken dictatorship? I think the answer is twofold: First, we suffered an erosion of the essential elements of democracy. After becoming president in 1999, within a year, Chávez changed the national constitution and called for a “mega-election” that saw him inaugurated for a six-year term. He changed the political structure of the country; packed the Supreme Court; took control over the National Electoral Council; and labeled critical members of the free press as “enemies of the homeland.”     Your rights could be taken away rapidly. I know because it happened to me         Second, this democratic erosion was met with an immoral neutrality from democracies around the world. When we the Venezuelans were losing our freedoms, too many people in the region believed that our problem was not also their own. I witnessed this tragedy from my position as a local politician.            After studying abroad in the US in the early 1990s, I returned to Venezuela and ran for public office in 2000. I was elected and reelected as mayor of Chacao, a powerful municipality in Caracas that is home to almost 80,000 people. For eight years, we proved that it was possible to serve democratically in a country being led in the opposite direction.            That changed in 2008, when I was disqualified from running for governor of Caracas city, despite two consecutive successful terms as mayor of Chacao and over 70% popular support. Under Chávez, the National Comptroller banned my participation in any electoral process on charges of corruption and financial impropriety – a ban that went into effect before I was even formally charged with these false accusations. With no place to look for justice within my country, I took my case to the Inter-American Court of Human Rights, and I won. In response, Chávez’s regime formally withdrew Venezuela from the inter-American system and, naturally, dismissed the ruling in my favor.            Unable to serve, I visited towns and cities across the country, from the Colombian border to the Atlantic coast. I wanted to prove that it wasn’t necessary to be an elected authority to serve our people. What I saw on that journey were Venezuelans who were more than ready to fight for freedom and democracy. That experience led me, along with other democratic leaders, to establish the political party Voluntad Popular, a national movement steeped in grassroots activism.           When Chávez’s successor, Maduro, rose to power in 2013, I asked our movement, “Are we living in a democracy, or a dictatorship?” We agreed on the latter. Inspired by nonviolent resistance from around the world, including the Orange Revolution, the Arab Spring, and US civil rights movements, we chose to peacefully protest Maduro’s regime.            The Venezuelan government’s response to our demonstrations was ruthless, and strikingly similar to what we have seen reported from the streets of countries around the world, from Belarus to Nicaragua: police brutality against peaceful protesters, arbitrary arrests and torture of opposition leaders, protesters sent into exile and some killed, as the UN has documented.            In February 2014, Maduro ordered my arrest and that of other Voluntad Popular members. Despite international criticism that I was arbitrarily detained, I was prosecuted and sentenced to nearly 14 years after a trial controlled by the dictatorship – proceedings the UN criticized for lack of transparency and violation of due process. I spent more than three years in a military prison, where I endured physical and psychological torture. When my wife and other supporters shared what was happening to me, Maduro’s government denied the abuse.      Sign up for our new newsletter.Join us on Twitter and Facebook         Many ask why Maduro is still in power, despite massive and ongoing protests. The truth is that he’s in power because he’s a dictator, and his regime’s response has been the same as others: repression and incarceration, the dictator’s recipe to hold on to power.            Perhaps we need to understand that authoritarianism is a global phenomenon. Dictators, in fact, understand this very well. They form political allegiances to protect each other internationally and have developed a transnational repression policy in order to persecute those who oppose them. This is a global problem, and its solution should be global as well.           To achieve democratic change in Venezuela, we must be part of a larger, globally organized effort. This idea is what convinced me to risk my life to escape from my country last year to resettle in Spain: A desire to be part of an international front that would help not only the people of Venezuela, but all those who live under authoritarian regimes.     © 2023 Cable News Network.

opinion,I was born in a Chinese ‘reeducation camp.’ I’m watching history repeat itself,https://www.cnn.com/2021/11/08/opinions/uyghur-human-rights-history-repeat-itself-turkel/index.html," Editor’s Note: Nury Turkel is a senior fellow at Hudson Institute, vice chair at the US Commission on International Religious Freedom and fellow of the Renew Democracy Initiative’s Frontlines of Freedom project. The views expressed in this commentary are his own. View more opinion on CNN.         I was born in a Chinese reeducation camp, where my mother was detained in the Xinjiang Uyghur Autonomous Region, which many Uyghurs call East Turkistan. For most of my life, I tried to forget the horrific experiences my mother and I had during my early childhood. But it seems the past is repeating itself – and with a vengeance.           When I was born, the Uyghur region – like the rest of China – was in the throes of Mao Zedong’s Cultural Revolution. It was a period of totalitarian zeal: Almost anyone suspected of not being adequately communist was beaten, jailed or killed. Religious and ethnic minorities were particular targets.            Mao’s zealots, called the Red Guards, came to the traditional Uyghur homeland to enforce the brutal policies of the tyrannical regime. The Red Guards burned religious texts, destroyed mosques, banned Uyghur-language books and ordered millions of Uyghurs – including my mother – into reeducation camps to be indoctrinated in Maoist doctrines and to be “reformed” through hard labor.            While arbitrary reeducation on a large scale experienced a lull following the end of the Cultural Revolution, forced labor programs have remained a human rights concern in China in spite of the economic reforms of the following decades.            Now, some half a century later, China is targeting the Uyghur population with a new fervor.  According to the US Department of Defense, China has detained possibly as many as 3 million Uyghurs in detention camps. Meanwhile, based on satellite imagery, CNN reports China has been destroying traditional Uyghur cemeteries. And, according to the accounts of several Uyghur women, it is incorporating an extensive forced sterilization program.      Our generation will either renew democracy -- or lose it forever         Having experienced the reality of living under this regime, and now watching with horror as these atrocities are visited on my Uyghur brothers and sisters, it’s difficult for me to comprehend how any Western actor could push for greater dialogue or engagement with such a regime.             How cheap are the lives of my people to the international community if it ignores reports of the Chinese government’s attempt to commit genocide against the Uyghurs? Democracies and nongovernmental organizations alike must do significantly more to support the Uyghur struggle – even if it comes with an inevitable backlash from the Chinese government.           Since leaving China in 1995 to seek political freedom and pursue graduate education, I have made it my mission to speak out against the horrors perpetrated against the Uyghurs, despite the serious consequences I have had to pay. I have not seen my mother or father for more than 17 years. The Chinese authorities have prevented my ailing and aging parents from leaving to reunite with their American children and grandchildren. Though my parents have never been given a clear reason for this, I strongly believe it is because of my criticism of the Chinese government.            As a lawyer, human rights advocate, and now vice chair for the US Commission on International Religious Freedom (USCIRF), I have advocated for human rights and religious freedom in China and around the world for many years. And, in these capacities, I have seen real progress in raising awareness of the atrocities perpetrated in the Uyghur region. But to have any meaningful impact, the world’s leading democracies must pursue a bolder strategy aimed squarely at hitting China where it hurts – weaponizing import bans and strategic investments.           Appallingly, many of the products enjoyed by Western countries are made by interned Uyghurs in China. According to several reports, Uyghur forced labor contributes significantly to the world economy – particularly solar-panel manufacturing and cotton-growing industries. In a liberal international order, there can be no room for forced labor.            The US Senate has taken serious steps forward on this issue by passing the Uyghur Forced Labor Prevention Act, which establishes broad import bans on products from the Uyghur region. The US House of Representatives, which passed an earlier version of the bill in 2020, must now move quickly to pass this bill, so that President Joe Biden can sign it into law.           Our European partners – another enormous market for Chinese products – must follow suit, and the United States should encourage our allies to join us in rooting out this evil practice. While the European Union is currently crafting due diligence protocol to address human rights violations within EU supply chains, it has not given a strong enough indication that it will adopt broad import bans for products produced by Uyghur forced labor.            Europe endured the worst of the horrors of Nazism, fascism and communism – and should understand the consequences of failing to act in the face of a regime that seeks to eradicate minority groups. If the EU is to have any credibility as a moral leader, it must ban the import of products from Xinjiang.           Indeed, such bans, which go further than many of the existing sanctions already in place, can go a long way toward mitigating the atrocious crimes that Beijing is committing in the Uyghur homeland. Consider some of the US sanctions, which are already proving to be effective at chipping away at two things the Chinese party leadership cares most about – economic interests and public image.      Chinese whistleblower exposes torture of Uyghur prisoners in CNN interview         Banning the import of agricultural products – such as cotton and tomatoes – has fractured the supply chains for the fashion and food industries. And the enforcement measures behind these sanctions have also created pressure points for US companies, forcing them to recognize the risks of doing business in China while also facing administrative, legal and reputational risks in the United States. In addition, public naming and shaming through the use of sanctions has sent a powerful message to Beijing that perpetrators of human rights abuses cannot remain anonymous.            That’s not to say that this is a risk-free proposition for the countries implementing such a ban. Italy is one of the leading global importers of goods from Xinjiang, and it may be challenging for such a country to cut itself off from Xinjiang products, even if it would like to. That’s why it’s critical for powerful economies like the United States and other democracies to invest in viable alternatives to China’s forced-labor products, thereby making it easier for countries to diversify their supply chains.           This June, the US Senate passed the US Innovation and Competition Act, which designates $250 billion to boost American scientific research, design and semiconductor manufacturing. The United States and its democratic partners should consider similar legislation to boost the manufacturing of products that have until now been dominated by companies operating with forced labor in Xinjiang.      Sign up for our new newsletter.Join us on Twitter and Facebook         Both Donald Trump’s and Joe Biden’s administrations have labeled China’s actions toward the Uyghurs as a genocide, and the Canadian, British, Dutch and Lithuanian Parliaments have concurred. State signatories to the United Nations Genocide Convention are obliged to take action to halt genocide when it occurs and punish the perpetrators. Yet so much more remains to be done to address the continuing horrors of Xinjiang.           This cuts to the legal and moral core of the liberal international order. The dual strategy of import bans and domestic investment may not be a panacea, but it is undoubtedly a meaningful step in the right direction. After watching a lifetime of abuse by the Chinese regime, such actions give me at least a glimmer of hope that Uyghur lives mean more to the international community than platitudes.     Editor’s Note: The Chinese government has repeatedly denied any allegations of crimes – including forced labor and forced sterilization – against the Uyghurs and other Turkic peoples. It claims it is providing the Uyghurs with education at “vocational training centers” while assisting in deradicalization efforts to combat alleged terrorism.   © 2023 Cable News Network.

The views expressed in this commentary are his own. View more opinion on CNN.         If you want to understand how American politics has become more polarized and extreme over the last decade, look no farther than Asheville, North Carolina – now split between two of the most gerrymandered districts in the country.      Gerrymandering – the dark art of drawing political maps to favor one party and disadvantage the other, which can be traced back to the earliest days of the nation – fundamentally altered the nature of political representation in the largest city in western North Carolina.            Artists, independent spirits and environmentalists have traditionally flocked to this hippie enclave, surrounded by conservative hill towns, for the majestic Blue Ridge Mountains, thriving local brewpubs, vegan cafes and independent bookstores.           And, a decade ago, North Carolina’s 11th congressional district, with Asheville at its heart, was among the nation’s most competitive, see-sawing with shifting political winds. It favored Republicans during the two elections that followed the September 11 attacks, then veered toward Democrats beginning in 2006 as the Iraq war stagnated and stock market tumbled.            This district does not swing any longer. Asheville is now represented by two of the most conservative members of Congress, including the outgoing chairman of the House Freedom Caucus, who have won their races since 2012 by double-digit averages.           Why? Because while the old map preserved Asheville in one competitive district, the new one sliced the city in half, scattering its voters across two districts in a way that ensured a Republican captured both seats.      North Carolina court steps up to defend democracy         But when the 11th district switched from a toss-up to safely Republican, the entire political dynamic changed. Without a competitive general election, the real action moved to the GOP primary, where turnout tends to be lower, and limited to the activist base. Only the most ideological extreme candidates stood a chance.            Enter Mark Meadows, who won the 2012 GOP primary here with a vow to “send Mr. Obama home to Kenya or wherever it is.” He’s held the seat since. Once arriving in Washington, Meadows ousted then-GOP Speaker John Boehner with a parliamentary maneuver, and became the architect of the 2013 government shutdown, as well as multiple Obamacare repeal efforts. And he’s now one of President Donald Trump’s most ardent defenders against impeachment.            Not surprisingly, many locals are unhappy with this reality. “The majority of the electorate in Asheville feels that their views are not represented in Congress,” Mayor Esther Manheimer said in March. The matter is not settled; judges recently blocked the congressional map from being used in 2020 elections.           Of course, this story is not unique to Asheville. All over the country, partisans have cracked cities in two, drawn districts that look like Donald Duck kicking Goofy and exploited new technology and advanced data to maximize gains.           And the consequences for democracy continue to be catastrophic, locking in a new era of minority rule across multiple states, distorting the competitive balance of congressional delegations and placing public policy – and many politicians – beyond the reach of the ballot box.            But which came first: the extreme gerrymanders or the heightened polarization? The reality is that each acts as an accelerant on the other, exacerbating a situation these politicians candidly describe in amicus briefs before the US Supreme Court as a Montague vs. Capulet-styled Shakespearean bloodbath.           Gerrymandered districts have also helped create an epidemic of minority rule nationwide, driving state politics to extremes not supported by voters who find themselves unable to do anything about it.     Almost 60 million Americans live in a state where one or both chambers of legislature is controlled by the party that won fewer statewide votes in the 2018 election. A new study finds that with fair lines, 59 congressional seats would have changed hands in 2012, 2014 and 2016. (Republicans gained 39 seats they would not have won; Democrats secured 20.)     What's pulling America apart?         Of course, gerrymandering has been part of our politics from the start. The bad news for democracy is that we’re better at gerrymandering than ever before. Powerful computers, sophisticated mapping software and terabytes of voter, census and consumer data – alongside growing polarization – make it possible to draw surgical district lines that provide sturdy bulwarks against electoral waves and maximize partisan advantage across an entire state.           It’s more than geography: Multiple academic studies, involving tens of thousands of neutral maps, consistently show that the partisan-drawn maps in the most gerrymandered states are radical outliers.           Neither political party has more historical virtue when it comes to gerrymandering, but GOP strategists outplayed their DNC counterparts ahead of the 2010 election, recognizing that redistricting provided a path back to power after the party’s 2008 walloping at the hands of President Barack Obama.           In fact, the GOP invested $30 million into state legislative races in closely divided states like Ohio, Wisconsin and North Carolina, seeking to win full control of congressional and state legislative maps. The lines Republicans drew the following year stuck.     Sign up for our new newsletter.Join us on Twitter and Facebook         It was a political masterstroke: Every 10 years, following the census, congressional lines are redrawn to account for population changes. In most states, the state legislature takes the lead, so the GOP’s modest investment paid handsome dividends. (As a result, Democrats controlled the process in fewer states than Republicans, so they lacked the same opportunities to gerrymander in 2010. They did take full advantage of their biggest opportunity, drawing a map that pushed their advantage in Maryland all the way to 7-1.)            But most Americans vote in uncompetitive districts, where the outcome is pre-ordained and reflective of only the most partisan extremes. Uncompetitive districts elect a different kind of politician, who is then incentivized to cater only to their base.            Congress, meanwhile, has an approval rating in the upper teens, yet upward of 95% of incumbents coast to re-election. No wonder Americans feel frustrated.             It doesn’t have to be this way. Americans hate gerrymandering and believe in fair elections, evident by the various initiatives and constitutional amendments that passed in 2018, including successful efforts to stop politicians from drawing their own districts and choosing their own voters in Michigan, Missouri, Colorado, Ohio and Utah.            Many of our national divisions are real and difficult to bridge. Gerrymandering, however, is self-inflicted. We’ve done this to ourselves – but we can undo it, too.    © 2023 Cable News Network.

opinion,Van Jones: We got together on this issue.

The views expressed in this commentary are his own. Read more opinion on CNN.         In this era of extreme political division, one issue is bringing people together: the need to invest in public safety solutions that reduce crime and make the criminal justice system fairer.           For the first time in my life, it appears every presidential candidate is running as a champion of criminal justice reform – including (to the shock of many) Donald J. Trump. It is an astonishing reversal in both political parties. For decades, ambitious politicians tried to outdo each other with “lock ‘em up” policies and “tough-on-crime” rhetoric.           This dynamic accelerated after George H.W. Bush crushed Massachusetts Democrat Michael Dukakis in the 1988 presidential race. Popular wisdom attributed the win to television ads spotlighting a prisoner named Willie Horton, who committed heinous crimes while part of Dukakis’ prison furlough program. Afterward, generations of politicians were afraid to champion prison reform.           So, how did justice reform emerge as the one cause that brings people together? The answers are complicated – and surprising.           I have a special perspective on the topic. In California, the Ella Baker Center for Human Rights, which I co-founded in 1996, helped to close five abusive youth prisons; we also blocked construction of a draconian “super jail for youth” near Oakland. Five years ago, I co-founded the Dream Corps’ #cut50 campaign with Jessica Jackson and Matt Haney, through which we passed more than a dozen bipartisan criminal justice bills at the state level, plus last year’s federal First Step Act. This year, I helped launch the REFORM Alliance, which aims to shrink and transform the probation and parole systems.            I have dedicated my life to this cause. But I have never seen anything like 2019 – a year in which all presidential candidates and both parties are fighting over who can be trusted to put fewer people behind bars while reducing crime.           Any shift of this magnitude has many causes. Let’s explore the top five:      1. The trifecta         We are benefiting from an extraordinary trifecta: low crime rates, a strong economy and both parties being fed up with our bloated, ineffective prison system.     10 reasons to celebrate the First Step Act         Politicians can more easily embrace reform when job numbers are up. President Barack Obama helped put the US economy into recovery and, under Trump, unemployment has continued to decline. Now, there are more open jobs in some cities than there are qualified workers. And yet, too many job categories still exclude people with criminal records. But, in this economy, more employers are willing to hire formerly incarcerated people, and more lawmakers are willing to invest in job training, “second chance” and “clean slate” bills to help the formerly incarcerated start new lives.           Finally, lawmakers eventually got frustrated investing billions into a system that was failing to rehabilitate a majority of people who came into contact with it. Incarceration fatigue opened the door to new ways of thinking about crime prevention that address underlying causes – like mental health, drugs, trauma, etc. And so leaders began shifting resources to create specialty courts – veterans courts, drug courts, mental health courts – across the country.     2. Culture shift         The television series, “Orange is the New Black,” brought binge-watching Americans inside the lives of women living behind bars. Ava DuVernay’s explosive documentary, “The 13th,” and Netflix series, “When They See Us,” broke hearts. Other documentaries and podcasts, from “Time: The Kalief Browder Story” to “Serial,” opened the public’s eyes.      Ava DuVernay's compelling look at tragic injustice of Central Park Five case         Authors like Michelle Alexander and Bryan Stevenson shook the consciences of those who read their works. Shaka Senghor’s bestselling book, “Writing My Wrongs,” won the admiration of Oprah Winfrey and helped to open the floodgates for formerly incarcerated authors. And in recent years, household names like Common, John Legend, Alicia Keys and Kim Kardashian have become outspoken advocates.           This wave of popular media pushed into mainstream living rooms and reached beyond the pool of those who once paid attention to the incarceration system. It is now common knowledge that the United States, shamefully, has the highest incarceration rate in the world.     3. Democratic value: Justice         Many people assume that Democrats always opposed mass incarceration. That is a myth. Democrats overwhelmingly backed President Bill Clinton’s disastrous 1994 crime bill. The deep blue state of California just recently began to dig itself out of an incarceration crisis that resulted in the construction of more than 20 prisons but only one university in the past generation. And the national Democratic Party’s platform carefully excluded any reference to criminal justice reform until 2016.           So, what changed? Many things – from #BlackLivesMatter to the opioid crisis.           Seeing African American communities devastated by decades of overpolicing and excessive incarceration, a new generation of black activists rebelled. Starting in 2013, they demanded that Democrats address head-on the issues of racist police abuse and racial bias in the justice system. Their passion gave more political room for traditional civil rights and civil liberties organizations to accelerate their own longstanding reform efforts.     Klobuchar: On criminal justice reform, it's time for a second step         Their grass-roots protests also gave Obama a greater impetus and opportunity to champion criminal justice reform. He took full advantage – granting clemency to close to 2,000 inmates, pushing hard for bipartisan legislation and even becoming the first-ever sitting US president to visit a prison. His attorneys general, Eric Holder and Loretta Lynch, reshaped the Department of Justice – with a focus on incarcerating fewer people. And, in 2016, Hillary Clinton’s platform included a plank calling for criminal justice reform – an issue no nominee had touched for decades.           Pushed past the breaking point, the incarceration generation rose up and insisted that Democrats speak out boldly against the racial injustice in the system. Today, all Democrats echo their call. The protests that started in 2013 have yielded a Democratic Party today that is more firmly grounded in its core ideals of racial, gender and social justice.           But Democrats also know the Republicans aren’t going to “Willie Horton” them, since so many conservatives are also embracing the cause.       4. Republican value: Liberty         Many on the left doubt the sincerity of criminal justice reformers on the right. They can’t believe that Republicans would truly care about a “racial justice” issue. But the truth is that Republicans have their own reasons to oppose the incarceration industry.           Republicans care a lot about public safety. But the “tough on crime” system made many communities less safe. Today, many conservatives want an evidence-based system that focuses on reducing crime. They’ve returned to principles that resonate deeply on the right as they joined the fight for reform.           One such principle is the need for fiscal prudence with taxpayer dollars and less government waste. Fiscal conservatives balk at the $80 billion annual price tag of mass incarceration. That’s one reason Republican governors, like Rick Perry in Texas and Nathan Deal in Georgia, passed reform bills that saved millions of dollars and (in Texas) even closed several prisons, all while bringing the crime rate down.       Koch network: We're rejecting partisanship in favor of problem solving         Another conservative principle is the desire for transparency, accountability and limits on government overreach. Libertarians especially don’t want the government to have too much power over individual lives. The Koch brothers fall into this category. So do US Sens. Mike Lee and Rand Paul and advocacy groups like FreedomWorks.           Yet another conservative value is the faith-based belief in human dignity. Religious conservatives, including Newt Gingrich, worry the present system leaves no real opportunity for second chances or personal redemption. When he was the Republican governor of Mississippi, Phil Bryant explicitly cited his Christian faith as the source of his passion for prison reform.           Black pro-Trump conservatives like Candace Owens and Katrina Pierson are working to return a pro-Lincoln, pro-freedom ethic inside the GOP on this issue.           In theory, of course, all conservatives should oppose a big, failed government bureaucracy that produces bad outcomes while eating up taxpayer dollars. America’s massive prison industry today represents a classic case of this phenomenon. And more and more Republicans – from Right on Crime to Faith & Freedom Coalition to The American Conservative Union Foundation – are willing to say so.     5. The Trump factor         Then there is the most surprising plot twist of all: Trump’s decision to release Alice Johnson.  The world watched as Johnson, a 63-year-old grandmother who had been sentenced to die in prison, ran across the road into her family’s arms. We began to hear the President shift from describing himself as “tough on crime” to expressing that he’s tough but fair and recognizing the disproportionate sentencing in the justice system. Surrounded by law enforcement, faith leaders, Republican members and even several Democrats, Trump then endorsed adding sentencing reform to the First Step Act, which he signed into law later that year.      Sign up for our new newsletter.Join us on Twitter and Facebook         Because many red state governors took the lead, this Republican President could engage on criminal justice reform without risking his base. More importantly, key people in Trump’s inner circle – including his son-in-law, Jared Kushner – were strong allies. This opened the door for formerly incarcerated people (on the left and right) to make repeated visits to the White House, sharing their experiences with senior officials of how the existing system failed them.           People on both sides of the aisle should be glad that Trump decided to adopt the cause – and not crush it. Criminal justice reform could have fallen into a divisive stalemate like guns, climate or immigration. Instead, Trump’s decision to embrace criminal justice reform has set Republicans free to work with Democrats. That’s a good thing for both parties – and a very good thing for the people suffering behind bars.           I’ve spent time in red states, blue states, Appalachia and urban neighborhoods. I see the same problems everywhere: generational poverty, addiction, underperforming schools, lack of access to mental health services and a broken criminal justice system. Neither party has been able to make a real dent in these problems facing low-income communities.            The sad truth is that Republicans get a lot of votes from poor, rural communities – but have failed to sufficiently improve conditions or expand opportunity there. Democrats get a lot of votes from poor, urban communities – but we have failed to sufficiently improve conditions or expand opportunity there. That’s why I came to believe in bottom-up bipartisanship – centered on addressing the pain of the people at the bottom in both parties.           However, here is what I know: Change is possible – and criminal justice reform is evidence of that. As recently as 2014, the idea of “bipartisan criminal justice reform” was an oxymoron. Now it is almost a cliché. And, symbolically, Alice Johnson has replaced Willie Horton as the iconic image of a formerly incarcerated person.            When I started 25 years ago, politicians in both parties promised to lock up more people, treat them more harshly and keep them behind bars longer. Today, leaders in both parties say we should lock up fewer people, help them transform their lives and send them home better, not bitter.           Criminal justice reform is renewing the right’s dedication to individual “liberty” and deepening the left’s commitment to social “justice.” As a result, we still have a chance to build a country with “liberty” and “justice” for all.    © 2023 Cable News Network.

opinion,Conservative: She was not a faceless liberal,https://www.cnn.com/2019/12/04/opinions/living-room-conversation-republican-perspective-song/index.html," Editor’s Note: Julia Song is a Brazilian-American political activist and commentator, who has been featured on OANN, Rebel Media and elsewhere. Follow her on Twitter @realjuliasong. The views expressed in this commentary are her own. View more opinion on CNN.         I am a political activist by nature. In my home country of Brazil, I helped organize peaceful protests against government corruption and abuses of power. At the time – way back in 2013 – Brazil was plagued by scandal, with much of the population living in poverty. And yet the country’s politicians, the source of so much of the scandal, continued to push agendas that benefited themselves and few others.            But with excessive spending on the World Cup draining the country’s already depleted resources, I was able to find a path forward with Brazilians from across the political spectrum. Our collective protests helped lead to a government investigation into corruption. Ultimately, many politicians went to prison, and the country’s president – Dilma Rousseff – was impeached.             Shortly after the protests, I moved to the United States on a family visa, where I was granted temporary residency, allowing me the right to work. I then began a four-year-long process to gain full citizenship, navigating the complexities and the financial costs of the American immigration bureaucracy.           Arriving to this new country, I thought that my activism days were behind me. But then I noticed a growing political divide between the elites, or establishment politicians, and working-class Americans just trying to get by. Sensing the disconnect – and the growing power of the political elite – I began using the power of social media to raise awareness of the issue, first on Instagram, and then on Twitter.            I advocated for my belief in a smaller government that guarantees more individual freedoms – and allows everyday Americans a chance at success. If you haven’t guessed yet, I’m a Republican, and I support President Donald Trump’s emphasis on fighting for ordinary Americans.      Voting for Trump cost me my friends         It was this reemergence in politics – and the divisive rhetoric that often animates it – that motivated me to partake in a Living Room Conversation’s session on immigration. I did so at the invitation of Sue Googe, a fellow Republican and former candidate for North Carolina’s 4th District.            Seeing how politically divided America had become – and fearful of its resemblance to parts of Brazil – I knew I had been given a rare opportunity. While Sue and I took a conservative approach to immigration, emphasizing the need to preserve our American values and rule of law, three Democrats argued a more liberal position. One, in particular, stood out to me – Rremida Shkoza, an Albanian refugee to the United States.           Rremida, like Sue, had grown up under a communist regime. While Rremida’s family fled Albania, Sue had fled China – but both shared a deep fear and suspicion of communist rule. I, who had experienced Brazilian socialism – which bore eerie similarities to communism with its emphasis on dangerously large government – was also skeptical, having experienced a government descent into corruption.     Tribalism isn't the real reason America is divided         But while Sue and I felt that Democratic socialism – and its liberalism on open borders and expanded government – was a threat to American democracy, Rremida seemed to think it was the solution to many of our problems. Having fled a dictatorship, Rremida felt that the United States had an obligation to keep its doors open to any and all asylum seekers. And while she acknowledged all people entering the United States should be vetted, she believed the government, in an expanded form, could accommodate those in need of refuge and freedom.           While I disagreed with her approach, I, too, see the humanitarian issue with refugees seeking asylum. And I lamented the fact that Republicans, while feeling for refugees, fail to clearly express that sentiment publicly.            But, unlike Rremida, I know the cost of illegal immigration on the system. As I attempt to navigate the legal system with my family, I bear the heavy weight of having to divide precious resources with immigrants who did not come here through legal means. In Brazil, my mother and brother both depend on each other for income, and while I would love to bring them here to escape the violence, it is almost impossible to bring one without the other. But to bring them here together – following all federal guidelines – could take years, as American courts battle growing immigration backlogs.             This is why I told Rremida and her fellow Democrats that the solution to immigration begins by improving the legal system – and channeling the necessary resources to continue to bring the brightest minds across the globe to the US. But it also means cracking down on illegal immigration, building a wall if needed, to dissuade people from coming via that route and jamming up the judicial system with their immigration claims.      Sign up for our new newsletter.Join us on Twitter and Facebook         Rremida, though not entirely agreeing, seemed to understand how my family’s experience was impacting my view of the system. While she may not have endorsed building a wall, she agreed that the distribution of resources on immigration was problematic.            Still, despite our differences, I felt she and I shared a common set of values – compassion, patriotism and a belief that our shared country could be a better version of itself. We may disagree on how to accomplish this – through a border wall or increased refugee intake, for example – and we may even disagree on the priorities of the federal government, but we agreed that illegal immigration is a challenge, and comprehensive immigration reform is vital to solving that problem.             To know a Democrat also cares about the issue of immigration, but may have a different approach to reforming the system, helps me make peace with our policy differences. Instead of being a faceless liberal, Rremida is now a fellow American with a unique set of experiences that color the way she sees the world – and the role she thinks America should play in it. And our ability to meet in the same living room, to get out of our red vs. blue silos, gives me a tremendous amount of hope.           Among the biggest takeaways, I learned that much of the ground work for bridging political divides starts in homes across America. It starts at the community level, where Americans who are already united by ties to a specific place can come together and hash out their differences.     © 2023 Cable News Network. A Warner Bros.

opinion,SE Cupp: A third party could get us out of this mess,https://www.cnn.com/2019/12/04/opinions/third-party-need-united-states-cupp/index.html," Editor’s Note: SE Cupp is a CNN political commentator and the host of “SE Cupp Unfiltered.” The views expressed in this commentary are solely hers. View more opinion articles on CNN.         In an NBC/WSJ poll earlier this year, only 1 in 10 adults agreed that the two-party system in this country was working fairly well.           This means that both parties are leaving a lot to be desired, according to voters, and many are coming to see the radical need for an alternative. In fact, 38% of respondents said the country needs a third party, the highest number who have said so since this poll began tracking the question in 1995.            And a third party that makes it its raison d’etre to represent the rest of the electorate might get a good look by voters in this environment.           Contributing to the need for an alternative party is the feeling that politics is dividing us up – and leaving a lot of us out. And the choices we’re usually left with, Republican or Democrat, aren’t good enough.           Just take this example from one of the early Democratic primary debates in June, when candidates were asked whether they supported decriminalizing our borders –that is, repealing Section 1325 of Title 8 of the US Code, which makes crossing the border without official inspection a misdemeanor offense.     Nine of 10 hands shot up.            As of an August tally by Politico, 14 Democratic candidates, some of whom are no longer in the running, had supported decriminalizing the border. For many progressive voters, the idea likely seemed necessary. After all, President Donald Trump was using the statute to detain and separate asylum-seeking families at the border.           Dem Rep. Alexandria Ocasio Cortez tweeted: “Border policy: As @JulianCastro mentioned in the #DemDebate, it’s time to repeal Section 1325 & 1326, the statutes this admin is using to mindlessly throw people in cages. We have to take these proceedings out of criminal code and into civil code. Torture accomplishes nothing.”     Trump is doing all the wrong things on immigration         What made the moment astonishing for anyone remotely in touch with voters – or who had read recent polls – was that this idea was far outside the mainstream. What many saw as simply ending the mechanism to determine whether immigration was legal or illegal is not popular.            According to an NPR/PBS News Hour/Marist poll among registered voters conducted shortly after that debate, decriminalizing the border enjoyed a paltry 27% of support.           But this was a Democratic primary – the candidates were at least speaking to their base, right?           No. Only 45% of Democrats thought decriminalizing the border a good idea, versus 47% who didn’t. When broken down even further, only 34% of moderate Democrats supported it, while 58% did not. And those coveted independent voters? Only 24% of them were on board.           Here was a policy proposal supported wholly by at least 14 Democratic candidates for president, and in some part by others, that had been resoundingly rejected by the majority of America, and also the majority of their own voters.            What was going on here? What were Democrats thinking?           This is emblematic of our new politics of extremes. In recent years, ultra-progressive voices on the left and only the Trumpiest of positions on the right seem to be winning out, while more moderate voices in both parties are going extinct.           On the right, just look at the fates of Jeff Flake, an Arizona Republican Senator forced into early retirement for his pushback against Trump, or Charlie Dent, a Pennsylvania Republican congressman whose centrist views within his party prompted him to resign before finishing his term, leaving his seat vacant. (Dent is now a CNN political commentator). And the pileup of Republican retirements grow almost by the day.           Over on the left, there is some unity in common cause against Trump, but Democrats are also eating their own. Ocasio-Cortez pushed her Queens predecessor, former Rep. Joe Crowley, out after 20 years in that seat. Voices like those in “the Squad” – Ocasio-Cortez, Rep. Ilhan Omar, Rep. Rashida Tlaib and Rep. Ayanna Pressley – get far more attention than their moderate counterparts.            A so-called “alterna-squad,” a group of moderate Democratic congresswomen including Rep. Abigail Spanberger, Rep. Mikie Sherrill, Rep. Elissa Slotkin and Rep. Chrissy Houlahan, has far less recognizable names. Unlike Ocasio-Cortez, none, for example, has been on “Jimmy Kimmel Live!”     The mythical independent voter isn't going to save us         Meanwhile, as Democrats and Republicans swing for the extremes, millions and millions of Americans are left without real representation. The 2020 primary is elucidating that. A line I’ve heard over and over again from moderates and independents after a Democratic debate is something to the effect of, “Well I can’t vote for Trump, but I’m not with those guys, either.”           In preferring to quadruple down on their most ardent base supporters, the parties are missing a wide swath of voters in the middle who are turned off by both the style and the substance of their increasingly absolutist proposals and their insistence that “finding common ground” is for wimps and traitors. (Just ask Democratic presidential contender Joe Biden how well it went over when he called Vice President Mike Pence “a decent guy.”)           Despite the rancor and fire-breathing on both sides, most voters are somewhere in the middle on any host of issues, even the most “divisive.”           Take abortion. “[M]ore than half of US adults take a non-absolutist position,” according to Pew. Only 12% of voters say abortion should be illegal in all cases, and 27% say it should be legal in all cases. The rest of us – the majority – agree it should be legal but with restrictions.           Gun control is another issue in which the majority often goes unrepresented.            A number of gun control proposals enjoy wide bipartisan support, even among Republican voters. Polls show 72% support requiring background checks for private gun sales. And yet, the majority of Republican lawmakers refuse to even consider that widely popular measure. Shouldn’t those voters feel betrayed by that?           Immigration, though, perhaps best encapsulates the political parties’ willingness to ignore majority opinions, even inside their own parties.           While Democrats are clear on wanting a pathway to citizenship for Dreamers and other undocumented immigrants, and Republicans frequently say that they don’t, what neither seem to get is where they share common ground.     Americans exaggerate the extremism of the other side         Believe it or not, a majority of Republicans (54%) believe there should be a way for undocumented immigrants to stay in this country legally – a path to legal status – if they meet some requirements over time.           And as it turns out, that’s what undocumented immigrants seem to prioritize as well. If we’re to believe the naturalization rates following former President Ronald Reagan’s 1986 amnesty bill, by 2009 only about 41% of those legalized had become American citizens. More than citizenship, many immigrants want to be able to come out of the shadows and work here legally.            So why are we arguing over citizenship instead of passing legal-status legislation, which enjoys majority support and even Republican support?           Here’s the easy answer to that and other head-scratching questions about who is actually representing us: Solving problems isn’t as politically profitable as keeping them broken.            Whether on immigration or gun crime, health care or climate, the two parties thrive when these issues remain broken. Democrats can fundraise off and run against xenophobic, gun-crazy, poor-hating, gas-guzzling Republicans, and Republicans do the same against open-border, gun-banning, wealth-redistributing, coal-killing Democrats.           Meanwhile, a majority of voters are left hanging with unsolved problems, somewhere in the middle of this never-ending scrum.     Avlon: Our polarized Congress can't address problems         As much as it seems like Republican voters just want to “own the Libs,” and Democratic voters are happy being “the resistance,” it might surprise you to know that there are plenty who actually want cooperation between the parties.           Just after the 2018 midterm elections, in which Democrats took back the House, a full 46% of Democratic voters said they thought Democratic leaders in Congress should cooperate a great deal or a fair amount with Trump over the next two years.           Even more astonishingly, 77% of Republicans said Trump should cooperate with Democratic leaders in Congress.           All of which is to say that neither party seems all that concerned with where voters in the middle are on policy or tone. That’s likely only going to get worse.           A third party could fill this void. This party wouldn’t be ideological in nature, as those already exist. It wouldn’t take this position or that one, and it wouldn’t have a charter or a platform committing to a fixed value set. Its only commitment would be to represent and support the majority of moderates and independents on every issue, wherever they are.           For example, right now independents represent 38% of the electorate, including those who say they lean Democrat or lean Republican – a.k.a. moderates. According to Pew, a third party representing these voters right now would support gay marriage and legalizing marijuana, it would oppose building a wall along the US-Mexico border and oppose increasing tariffs between the US and trading partners, and it believes that some government regulation is necessary to protect public interest and that a smaller government providing fewer services is best.            That third party would also lean pro-abortion – keeping Roe v. Wade in place – but would add some restrictions as to when and under what circumstances abortions should be given.           It supports stricter gun laws, background checks on all gun purchases and a ban on assault weapons. It doesn’t, however, support a mandatory assault weapon buy back, and it believes mental illness is a bigger cause of mass shootings than the availability of guns.     Sign up for our new newsletter.Join us on Twitter and Facebook         It would support raising taxes on companies that burn fossil fuels and believes human activity is causing the climate to change.           In other words, it would represent the unaffiliated middle that isn’t on either extreme. There wouldn’t be any litmus or purity tests. It would support and run candidates who pledge to represent the middle, and not chase either party as they move further and further to the fringes. The party wouldn’t have to contort itself to defend its leadership, because it would be driven by voters themselves.            One of the benefits of this sort of party is that it can’t, by definition, attract demagogues, cult figures or egomaniacs. Campaigns are framed around voter polling, not personality or promises of pie-in-the-sky change that only a few are demanding. The only promise is to listen to you and legislate accordingly.           Naturally, the biggest hurdle to a viable third party is the parties themselves. Both hold enormous influence over the presidential elections, from managing donor lists to unleashing get-out-the-vote apparatus.            There’s also the debates. Since the 1987 Commission on Presidential Debates was formed, both parties have fought to keep third-party interlopers out of the televised events. Ross Perot only won his place on the 1992 debate stage because both George H.W. Bush and Bill Clinton demanded he be allowed to participate, both thinking they would benefit.            So long as the parties control the means of production, so to speak, third-party candidates will be seriously disadvantaged.           Finally, whether an alternative party in today’s age of personality politics is realistic is a question for another essay. But just imagining a third party that isn’t swayed by cable news hosts, preening politicians, special interests, that isn’t designed solely to enrich coffers and play to an ever-shrinking base, but exists simply to reflect the moderate majority lowers one’s blood pressure almost instantly.           Because let’s face it: the two-party system, in all its absolutisms, is leaving many of us without representation. And if America’s future is in the hands of these two parties alone for much longer, we’ll all be politically homeless eventually.    © 2023 Cable News Network. A Warner Bros. Discovery Company.

opinion,John Avlon: Confronting the cult of partisan media,https://www.cnn.com/2019/11/22/opinions/partisan-media-confronting-political-division-avlon/index.html," Editor’s Note: John Avlon is a CNN senior political analyst. The opinions expressed in this commentary are his own. View more opinion articles on CNN.         America is self-segregating into separate political realities. And partisan media is driving much of this division across new platforms, polarizing for profit while amplifying extreme voices and achieving unprecedented reach – including the Oval Office.           President Donald Trump is a creature of partisan media, having kicked off his political career with regular appearances on Fox News. His obsessive consumption causes him to echo its talking points, often overriding information from US intelligence agencies. This leaves him susceptible to conspiracy theories that have now led to the fourth impeachment inquiry in our history.            We’ve always had partisan media in America, with Alexander Hamilton and Thomas Jefferson slashing each other in the pages of competing broadsheets on the same street in Philadelphia.           What we’re dealing with today is different because of the pervasive scale of partisan media and its dissemination alongside disinformation. Its proliferation has been hastened by the rise of a partisan economy amid a fragmented media market, aiming to keep a narrow but intense niche audience addicted to anger, anxiety and resentment. But this is a Faustian bargain, because it requires going to ever-increasing extremes to keep the audience engaged while constantly attacking the credibility of nonpartisan news organizations.           The rise of social media has balkanized us further, amplifying the loudest voices, often manipulating perceptions of public opinion via anonymous bots and trolls, while driving many reasonable people from the public square of civic debate. These disinformation deployments often shape the tone of partisan media while exploiting the lack of trust it has helped create.           The result is real: A new Pew Survey shows that 73% of Americans now believe that Republicans and Democrats cannot agree on basic facts. That’s a potential death sentence for a democracy that depends on reasoning together to solve common problems.            This is also an unhealthy departure from our best traditions. We had partisan newspapers in the past that, for example, excoriated and defended the New Deal, but there was still a general baseline commitment to facts and a clear delineation between news and editorial opinion. On the broadcast side, the fairness doctrine, introduced in 1949, was a condition of leasing federal airwaves that aimed to ensure balance by requiring time for opposing political views.            That doesn’t mean there were not deep disagreements and bitter debate.           America was tested by the rise of Sen. Joe McCarthy of Wisconsin, a conservative, populist anti-communist with a demagogue’s disregard for facts. While accusing Democrats of treason, McCarthy often tried to play the victim of the liberal elite media, equating The Washington Post with the communist Daily Worker – while in fact old-line Republican papers like the Chicago Tribune and New York Herald Tribune were also warning about McCarthy’s tactics.             McCarthy’s rise on the back of wild accusations caused some editors to question whether the traditional approach of simply reporting what a public official said was consistent with the larger responsibility of telling the truth. But McCarthy met his match in Edward R. Murrow, the legendary CBS broadcast news pioneer, who took on McCarthy by fact-checking his public statements, closing his show in March 1954 by saying, “We must not confuse dissent with disloyalty. … We will not be driven by fear into an age of unreason.”           But Murrow vs. McCarthy was a notable exception in a post-war period. Despite the stickiness of who was determining what was fair and balanced, the fairness doctrine proved surprisingly popular among conservatives and liberals who believed it ensured a degree of “public interest” programming. When it was overturned by the Federal Communications Commission in 1987, the Senate voted 59-31 to reinstate it on bipartisan lines – but it was vetoed by former President Ronald Reagan.           This is when partisan media as we know it began to proliferate.            One study by former chief economist at the FCC Thomas Winslow Hazlett, recounted in his book “The Political Spectrum,” found that talk radio took off after the fairness doctrine was dismantled, displacing what had been the most popular radio format: music. Our country got more polarized as partisan opinion became big business, untethered from any obligation to be fair and balanced.     Polarization is poisoning America. Here's an antidote         This was the moment Roger Ailes had been waiting for. A one-time talk show producer-turned-political consultant, Ailes pushed a political strategy called “positive polarization” in Richard Nixon’s 1968 presidential campaign. While Nixon repeated “the press is the enemy” like a mantra, Ailes envisioned the creation of a conservative news network that could counteract major newspapers and the big three networks.            Ailes had the opportunity to operationalize his partisan dream with the launch of Fox News in 1996. Extending the popularity of right-wing talk radio into cable news, the idea was simple and sinister: Only explicit bias could balance the implicit bias of the mainstream media. But in a breathtaking bit of cynicism, this partisan project would be sold as “fair and balanced.”           Later that same year, MSNBC launched and evolved into a liberal counterweight. The partisan media arms race was on. But what is good for ratings can be bad for the country.           The impact was clear: Just over a decade later, a Pew Survey on media credibility found that “virtually every news organization or program has seen its credibility marks decline.” Even C-SPAN, which offers unedited coverage of public events, experienced a steep decline in believability. In this hyper-partisan environment, people literally weren’t trusting what they see with their own eyes.           Instead of creating more informed citizens, partisan media compounded tribalism through an echo chamber – a loose network of blogs, talk radio and partisan cable news that mainstreamed conspiracy theories and increasingly gave talking points to party leaders rather than vice versa.            Then came social media. It promised to break down barriers, but instead of simply being a great leveler, it was quickly hijacked by operatives who realized that it was also the greatest vehicle for disinformation ever devised.             All these dynamics contributed to the rise of Donald Trump to the presidency. He took his reality television celebrity and morphed it into political influence with weekly segments on “Fox and Friends,” where he started peddling the birther conspiracy theory that former President Barack Obama was ineligible to be president.           But it was his use of Twitter to hijack news cycles with outrageous statements that really boosted his presidential campaign. What Trump understood better than most is that news doesn’t have a liberal or a conservative bias as much as a conflict bias – and he supplied constant conflict in ways that fired up his base while dominating news cycles on stations and sites across the political spectrum.           The Republican establishment couldn’t stop his rise, because the conservative base had become radicalized by hyper-partisan media while many on the center-right had opted out of the party.           It was a joint effort. During the 2016 campaign, Trump relied on regular strategic conversations with Ailes and Sean Hannity, while bringing on the former head of Breitbart News, Steve Bannon, to run his campaign. Put simply, Trump promoted hyper-partisan media, and they promoted him in return.           On the most extreme edge, we even learned that the campaign’s senior policy adviser, Stephen Miller, was back-channeling with Breitbart to influence their immigration coverage with white nationalist sites. On a far more prominent and less fringe scale, The Washington Post’s Erik Wemple chronicled Hannity’s many mentions in campaign emails and called him their “chief propagandist … looped in on all their talking points, their deflections and their innumerable attacks.”            During the final weeks of the campaign, when few even inside Trump’s orbit believed he could win, Trump was musing about starting his own right-wing television station – Trump TV – to be led by none other than Ailes. It would allow him to monetize the movement he’d begun while continuing its momentum based on the idea that the election had been stolen.           But trolls and bots on social media – many of them connected to Russia – were engaging in an all-out final push to try to elect Trump, exploiting the environment of extremism and distrust that partisan media created, posting intentionally fake stories at an accelerated rate. In the final three months of the campaign, the top performing intentionally false stories on Facebook – designed to benefit Trump and hurt Hillary Clinton – out-performed the top news stories from actual publications, according to the bipartisan Senate Intelligence Committee report.           The top two fake news stories were Pope Francis’ (non-existent) endorsement of Trump and Wikileaks’ “confirmation” of Hillary Clinton’s weapons sales to ISIS – which reached more than 1.7 million people. One analyst explained that “it seems pretty clear that false information outperforms true information.”           President-elect Trump quickly tried to twist the term “fake news” – which helped him win the election – to refer to any independent journalism that displeased him in any way. He has used the term more than 1,100 times since inauguration, according to Factba.se, while autocrats around the world approvingly picked up the term.     Trump's 'social media summit' isn't fearsome, it's pitiful         Partisan media was in the White House, and Trump’s relationship with Fox News became something unseen in American history – with the President constantly watching and tweeting out promos to friendly shows while hiring more than 20 administration aides from the extended Fox talent pool.           When his staffers burnt out or were forced out, they often found jobs at Fox – while a few lonely correspondents and anchors such as Shepard Smith committed to facts found themselves under fire from viewers as well as the President.           “I’ve never seen anything like it before,” Fox News president-turned-NYU journalism professor Joe Peyronnin told The New Yorker’s Jane Mayer. “It’s as if the President had his own press organization. It’s not healthy.”           We see that partisan media has completed its takeover of the White House – electing and bolstering an unpopular President while perpetuating a separate political reality for his supporters. But there is a cost to living in that closed environment.             The fourth impeachment inquiry in American history was launched because Trump bought into discredited conspiracy theories that Ukraine – not Russia – had hacked the Democratic National Committee while pushing that country’s new President to investigate the family of his chief political rival. These ideas were allegedly spread from interested parties and fringe sites to being investigated by Trump’s personal attorney, Rudy Giuliani – who fed information to The Hill’s John Solomon – whose articles created “evidence” used to justify the investigation. Solomon would in turn promote his stories on Hannity’s show on Fox News – creating a confirmation bias feedback loop built on falsehoods, or what the President’s supporters might call “alternative facts.”      Sign up for our new newsletter.Join us on Twitter and Facebook         The media coverage of the subsequent impeachment inquiry hearings was also polarized, with one side focused on testimony and facts, while the other side attacked the State Department and White House witnesses as “Never Trumpers,” “nerdy guys,” “radicals,” “partisan bureaucrats” and even a “self-important, very narcissistic diplomatic snowflake.” There’s an inability to agree on basic facts, and instead the politics of personal attacks seem to have aligned with the President’s talking points.            There’s no question that partisan media has driven the polarization that’s afflicting our nation. It is driving the agenda in the White House. And proximity to power creates a gravitational pull toward normalization.            But the partisan echo chamber is a route to radicalization. As Cass Sunstein explains in his book “Going to Extremes,” “A good way to create an extremist group, or a cult of any kind, is to separate members from the rest of society. The separation can occur physically or psychologically, by creating a sense of suspicion about non-members. With such separation, the information and views of those outside the group can be discredited, and hence nothing will disturb the process of polarization as group members continue to talk.”           Partisan media has gone from advancing an ideological agenda to something uglier, something like a cult that is peddling special knowledge – undermining our ability to reason together as Americans, while sharpening tribal divides.           Confronting this blizzard of lies is one of the defining challenges of our times. To reunite our nation, we must reassert the old wisdom that says everyone is entitled to their own opinion – but not their own facts – and report without fear or favor.

E. Wesley Ely is a physician and the Grant. W. Liddle Professor of Medicine and Critical Care at Vanderbilt University, Tennessee Valley VA GRECC, and the founder of the Vanderbilt ICU Delirium and Cognitive Impairment Study Group. The views expressed here are solely his.         “But can’t you help me die, Doc?”            My 54-year-old patient was alone in the intensive care unit, with no family or friends in his life. He slumped in his bed, gasping, staring up at me. Admitted with lung fibrosis and pneumonia, he had scars and infection aggressively replacing his airways, despite our best treatments.            As a newly minted doctor years ago, my mind was usually occupied with beeps and buzzers providing me technical information to help calculate choices about patients’ care. Having developed gray hair over many years at the bedside, my first priority is now more straightforward: to hear the voices of the vulnerable people looking up at me from their bed.  That is what I try to do as a physician, including, of course, what they tell me in the silences.             I pulled a chair next to his bed so we could talk at eye level.  His face was blank.  “I want euthanasia. I’m going to die soon, so what’s the point of living longer? I’m just wasted space.”            I felt nauseated.  The illegality of euthanasia was not what ran through my mind.  Instead I thought about how Paul had lost his sense of personhood. I thought about how I had chosen to become a doctor in the first place.       Share your story of how being a caregiver has changed you with #ToBeMe or text/WhatsApp us on +1-347-322-0415         I chose medicine as my calling after a childhood spent in the Deep South: Shreveport, Louisiana. My mother taught English there after my father, an engineer, had left her for another woman. I remember it was so hot that my siblings and I would fry eggs on the sidewalk. No joke. On most days, we’d walk to a nearby bayou and catch baby alligators for fun and fill up coolers with crawfish for dinner. That last part is important because we had no money at all. Dad wouldn’t pay anything to Mom, who didn’t make much as a teacher.  So I started working at the farm of a man who wanted to marry my mother. I worked 14-hour days from about five in the morning doing square bales of hay until seven at night picking vegetables and running the country store.            While I cherish those years and the formation that grueling work provided, I was determined to do something different with my life.  Mom told me that Dad had loved math and science, and she taught literature. So I figured it must come naturally for me to split the difference and do something with people, science and the arts. To me, that meant medicine.            I remember our first big assignment in sixth grade was to write a research paper on what we would be when we grew up. I rode my beat-up bicycle to the local library and began reading about how to become a physician: What was the process and what would it all mean? I walked out of the library that day having spent most of my time reading a long medical essay about truth. The author insisted that to be a physician, one has constantly to seek truth about the patient’s diagnosis, the best treatment, and the best way to serve each and every person. What I learned from the essay was that truth doesn’t change depending on our ability to stomach it. As I progressed through Jesuit high school and Tulane, this became a common theme in my pursuit of a life as a doctor: “Wrong is wrong even if everybody is wrong. Right is right even if nobody is right.” Numerous people are credited with some version of this quote, from actors to philosophers to theologians. That sense of truth drove my study and training and my realization that each person’s life has value beyond measure.           I knew long before I met Paul that I couldn’t kill another person just because he or she wanted me to, but I still had to find a way to respond to Paul’s request to die.           My response came in parts over my days with him.  First, I explained that, as his physician, I wanted to be with him through the dying process. I told him that I considered us to be in a mutual covenant.  We both had a degree of autonomy that had to be respected, but I would never intentionally harm him. “Paul, our covenant includes my limiting your suffering,” I said.  “You are the best judge of when you need more meds for pain, anxiety and breathing. All of us will work day and night to end your distress, but we won’t deliberately end your life.”            With our eyes locked, Paul gave his instruction: “Just don’t abandon me.”  And we sat there, as partners.           As a physician, there is no better place to be.  Perhaps especially amid the uncertainty, we must learn to partner with each person in the bonds of this two-way relationship.  He in need of help and me in need of helping.             Paul was receiving excellent palliative care for his physical symptoms, but it wasn’t enough.  It never is. Emotional isolation and despair can cast a shadow darker than disease.  Physicians fail our patients on a human level.  We forget that our patients are more than the sum of their medical conditions, so I asked Paul about other types of therapy — art, music, spirituality, pets, sunshine — that might help him.             “I want my music.  Can you get me the soundtrack for ‘Lord of the Rings’?”  Within minutes we had the songs playing in his room, and his demeanor changed from desolate to alert and engaged.  “I love music. It’s always been a motivator, but now … I don’t know.” He shifted in his bed. “My goals are gone.”           Nietzsche’s words came to my mind, “He who has a ‘why’ to live can bear almost any ‘how.’”      Viktor Frankl, as a physician-survivor of Auschwitz, used Nietzsche’s quote four times in his crucial analysis, “Man’s Search for Meaning.” I think this book should be required reading for medical students.           As with many patients, Paul’s story needed unpacking. “Paul, what did you do in life?”            He smiled and shrugged. “I’m a rare beast: a plumber who acts.  I do Shakespeare festivals.  You know, ‘The quality of mercy is not strained.’  I’ve been mulling over that line.  Years ago I didn’t understand it.  I do now.  Mercy should not be forced.  It’s better as a natural infusion, one person to another.”            I described for Paul the many years I spent alongside my single-mom-turned-Shakespeare-director, helping her cue actors.  As we talked, I watched his erratic oxygen levels fall and then partially recover, obliging us to take breaks.  Sweat would build up on his forehead, and, more than once, I worried that our conversation was too much of a strain. But we were unpacking, and it was essential.           That night I asked Christine, a nurse who loves theater, to sit and talk with Paul.  Soon their lives were interwoven, too.            “I think I helped Christine,” Paul said the next day. “My own illness made me forget that one of my ‘things’ is seeing when someone is hurting. And Christine is. She came to help me, but it turns out some really personal things in our background are weirdly similar.  I told her my way through the worst of it.” He paused, his thoughts far away.           It seemed like a good time to return to his previous request.  “Paul, you’ve asked for euthanasia, and you brought up Portia’s line from ‘Merchant of Venice’ about mercy.  Can we talk about these things?”  He nodded, and closed his eyes.           “We all want to be here with you in your suffering.  I want your opinion: I don’t think injecting you with a lethal drug would be truly merciful, but it would, in every sense of the word, be ‘strained.’ It would be a forced and unnatural ‘false’ mercy.  Whenever possible, mercy must also be lifting and healing.  I don’t want to abandon those key elements in serving you.”           His eyes opened wide. “Doc, talking with you and Christine about life’s best and worst times has helped.”  He took a deep breath, and I heard the whoosh of high-flow oxygen into his nostrils.  “Things I confided to Christine are helping her sort through her own struggles. She said she’s coming back tonight, and that means the world to me.”  Then, unwittingly, Paul paraphrased Nietzsche: “When we met, I was afraid of being a burden and not mattering. Now I feel different. I’m not a believer like others, but I guess I remembered the ‘why’ to live.”            Short of a war zone, there are few settings as raw as an ICU.  Yet treasured moments of human transformation come when people like Paul rediscover their “why,” even if just for an hour or a day.             I see many paths toward survival in the ICU, and for non-survivors, myriad paths toward death: sudden, prolonged, stuttering, reluctant, stoical – and these paths are dynamic, not static.           It is a rare patient who asks me for euthanasia, but it is nearly universal that dying patients seek help with suffering.  Sitting on their beds brings me right up against their fears, the greatest of which is usually not intolerable pain.            Lack of control is what bothers people the most, and it drives most requests for euthanasia, which is predominantly a first-world phenomenon.  As we have gained more and more ability to dictate so many aspects of our lives, looking ahead in uncertainty has become something people are not willing to tolerate.  As a physician, I find this is a very important “teachable moment” for most patients: helping them (and me) to live in the moment. Whitewashed along a wall in the home for destitute and dying in Kolkata, these words of Saint Mother Teresa became emblazoned in my mind, and I recalled them for Paul: “Yesterday is gone. Tomorrow has not yet come. We have only today. Let us begin.” He nodded in agreement.           Paul reminded me that the best remedy for angst is human relationship and community.     Sign up for our new newsletter.Join us on Twitter and Facebook         The problem with assisted suicide and euthanasia for Paul — and for others — is that it presented him with an illusion of ‘cure,’ when in reality it would have left him devoid of the healing he received.           And alongside the patient, of course, sits the physician.  The problem for me with intentionally administering lethal medications to end the life of another person is that it would rob me as a healer.  I would be qualitatively changed.  If I were ever to assume that I had authority over life to take it deliberately, it would, for me, create an irrevocable cavern of emptiness.  The infinite worth of every person outprices autonomy: What you and I want is less important than who we are.            Obviously, the approach I took with Paul won’t be an answer for everyone, yet it is too often left untried.  Some will say Paul’s story is merely an uplifting anecdote. Nevertheless, I hope to embrace the lessons I learned at his bedside for most of my patients, and I hope my colleagues do the same.

What we should be trying to heal is often not physical disease or clinical depression, but a person’s sense of insignificance and hopelessness, which we cannot heal by eliminating the person.           Paul died a week later. By then he realized his life was of value even with a terminal disease. In fact, the last thing he said to me, between gasps, was: “I’m glad I didn’t miss this time. I never saw it coming, Doc. … In losing my breath, I gained it.”      Note: The patient’s name and age have been changed for privacy.

Tomorrow has not yet come. We have only today. Let us begin.” He nodded in agreement.           Paul reminded me that the best remedy for angst is human relationship and community.

And alongside the patient, of course, sits the physician.  The problem for me with intentionally administering lethal medications to end the life of another person is that it would rob me as a healer.  I would be qualitatively changed.  If I were ever to assume that I had authority over life to take it deliberately, it would, for me, create an irrevocable cavern of emptiness.  The infinite worth of every person outprices autonomy: What you and I want is less important than who we are.            Obviously, the approach I took with Paul won’t be an answer for everyone, yet it is too often left untried.  Some will say Paul’s story is merely an uplifting anecdote. Nevertheless, I hope to embrace the lessons I learned at his bedside for most of my patients, and I hope my colleagues do the same.

What we should be trying to heal is often not physical disease or clinical depression, but a person’s sense of insignificance and hopelessness, which we cannot heal by eliminating the person.           Paul died a week later. By then he realized his life was of value even with a terminal disease. In fact, the last thing he said to me, between gasps, was: “I’m glad I didn’t miss this time. I never saw it coming, Doc. … In losing my breath, I gained it.”      Note: The patient’s name and age have been changed for privacy.

opinion,Together we make a family,https://www.cnn.com/2017/12/20/opinions/what-its-like-to-be-me-disability-rebecca-cokley-opinion/index.html," Editor’s Note: This piece is the second part of a CNN Opinion series, “What it’s like to be me,” which explores the personal struggles Americans face at a time of profound social change. Rebecca Cokley is a senior fellow at the Center for American Progress, where she works on disability policy. Formerly, she was the executive director of the National Council on Disability and served in the Obama administration in the Administration for Community Living and the Presidential Personnel Office, where she was responsible for outreach to diversity and minority organizations. The views expressed in this commentary are solely hers.         I was lying on the cold metal table in the operating room in the midst of giving birth to my second child, in what had been a totally normal and uneventful pregnancy, when the anesthesiologist assigned to my C-section suggested that my obstetrician might want to tie my tubes. He didn’t ask me. He didn’t even acknowledge that I was there, though I was in a ragged state of consciousness. He said, “While you’re down there, we are going to go ahead and tie her tubes, right?”           At a time when I was most vulnerable, a medical professional thought it was a good suggestion, an acceptable notion, to make an assumption with this level of this importance for me. My doctor, my husband, and I all responded unanimously: “No!”           As upsetting as that moment was, it was not at all surprising to be treated as less than fully human. Professionally, I work as an advocate for the disabled. But I also know from 39 years of life as a little person, situations like these are such a clear indication that we aren’t seen as whole people. No matter what we do, what we achieve, the nondisabled world will largely always see us as less than, as separate.           The delivery room wasn’t my first experience with ignorance around disability and family. It wasn’t always perfect for me growing up.  My high school guidance counselor told me point blank, “Kids like you don’t go here, you go to the special school.” If it weren’t for the teachers, whom I loved, I easily could have fallen into a different path because of how that counselor treated me.           I think about that, as I prepare to give birth again in a few months, to a boy who may be of average size. If he is, his mother and two siblings may always be “different” in a way that he is not.     Everyone’s “normal” is their own: Share your story of how you use being different to make a difference in your own life or others’ with #ToBeMe or text/WhatsApp us on +1-347-322-0415         When he comes, I’ll be having another C-section. Little people can only deliver that way, as our pelvic area is not large enough to deliver vaginally, so I’ve always had an anesthesiologist present for the entire procedure. General anesthesia is hard on those of us with dwarfism as well, because of how our faces are shaped and complexities in our airways, and spinal anesthesia, including epidurals, can also be hard depending on any spinal issues. For a long time the only option was putting us completely out, as was done with my mom during my delivery.           With my last delivery, I was already in a bad place with this anesthesiologist  – who was in a position of medical authority (even though he wasn’t ultimately in control of my treatment) and somehow thought my right to have more children was his business.   I had asked him to review the notes from my first C-section and my MRIs to make sure he felt confident he could do the job. But he failed, because the spinal block wore off halfway through the surgery and he had to help to determine alternate means of sedation – which resulted in him giving me a low level of general anesthesia to complete the procedure.           I don’t know for sure why he suggested I be sterilized, but I can only assume that he thought I should be medically prevented from having more kids because, like my children Jackson and Kaya, I was born with dwarfism. I’ve asked multiple nondisabled friends who have had the same anesthesiologist and none reported him making any remarks indicating he felt the same way about their right to bear children.           While I grew up in the Bay Area, I now live in Washington, D.C., with my husband and kids. Professionally and personally, being a little person is central to who I am, but it’s also one among many ways that I see and make sense of the world. For better and for worse, being different is hugely significant in my life, individually and with my family. And I think we should be more open with all kids about how being different can be a good thing, an important thing.           Part of the legacy of the landmark 1990 80% of people with dwarfism are the only person in their families with it).            My parents met in 1970 at a convention of Little People of America, an organization founded by actor Billy Barty in 1957 to provide support and information to people with dwarfism and their families. There are chapters around the world, affiliates internationally, and annual conventions that bring together around 2,000 people in different cities every year.            My dad ran a Center for Independent Living for people with disabilities and my mom ran a disabled student center at a local community college, so I grew up in the Bay Area surrounded by people with all different types of disabilities.           I also grew up in an environment where expectations of me were set high, by my family and by a strong network of supporters and allies. My mom went back to school for her bachelor’s and master’s degrees when I was around 8 or 9, as a re-entry student at the College of San Mateo and the College of Notre Dame, respectively.           I was a typical presence with her on campus, sitting in the back taking notes along with the other students (I was always nerdy). I remember getting in long discussions with one of the professors, who was a nun, about Kevin Smith’s latest film, “Dogma,” and her asking me to write a paper on it while I was still in junior high school.           It took a long time for me to realize that the experiences I had growing up, becoming an adult, and starting my own family were not always the norm – and that the work of achieving acceptance for those with disabilities was far from over.           All my life I wanted to work in civil rights, and found myself thinking of being a civil rights lawyer from an early age. I think having parents who were so civically engaged was a key piece of this, as was growing up in the San Francisco Bay Area during the onset of the AIDS epidemic. I remember that in the early days when it was still stigmatized as the “gay cancer,” my parents and I attended so many funerals. And at so many of them we were the only people there, minus a friend or two.           I asked my mom why we had to go (my 6 year old brain was much more focused on getting to the mall to go ice skating at the time) and I remember my mom telling me, “We’re here because no one deserves to have no one stand for them. They’re no different from us. We are here for the reason that someday, if something like this happens to our community, we’d hope they would be here for us.”           And I think in so many ways, that comment, while in passing, became my true north.           When I was 10, my dad passed away in his sleep after confronting health issues for years and using a wheelchair most of my life after a fall. Soon after, my mom took me to the Ringling Brothers circus. We were in the parking lot leaving the Cow Palace when I turned to my mom and said the seven words she had feared her entire life. “Mom, I think I want to be clown.” She slammed on the brakes so hard I thought my head would hit the dashboard. “What?” she asked.           “Yeah, I think I want to be a clown.” We rode home in silence. I didn’t realize at the time, but this was a huge crisis of faith for her. All I had ever talked about at that point was fighting injustice and here I was telling her I wanted to take on a role that focused on little people not being taken seriously.           I later learned that she broke down in tears with a group of fellow graduate students, telling them she had failed as a parent. A few weeks later, I told her I only wanted to be a clown because clowns traveled the world, and that I had returned to my senses and decided to be a civil rights attorney again. It was an important lesson in the importance of having high expectations and being flexible that would serve me repeatedly throughout my career and as a mom.           Because of my passion for civil rights, my parents introduced me at a young age to Paul Steven Miller, an up-and-coming attorney and little person who worked in Los Angeles. Miller went on to be the first little person to work in the White House, under President Clinton, and when he found out my love of reading, would routinely send me case briefs to read “for fun.”           My mom and dad thought it was important that I knew people like me doing the work I wanted to do. I got to return the favor in 2007, when I recruited my mentor Miller for the Barack Obama campaign and ended up following in his footsteps by taking a job at the White House in 2010.           Taking this path was important to me – and to my family as well.           When it came time to go to college, I started out at the same school where my mom had gone. I studied in London during my sophomore year of high school.   It was an incredible experience. Not only for all the amazing things that London offered, but also because manners often trumped the notion of treating disabled people in public like a sideshow. I didn’t have to worry about tourists taking photos of me, or having “midget midget” shouted at me in a bar, as had happened to me in the United States.           Returning home, I accepted a full scholarship to the University of Santa Cruz, where I decided to go into political science and study with professors like Wendy Mink, Peter Euben, and Angela Davis.           My first two jobs after college really shaped my life. One was an internship with my local member of Congress, Rep. Tom Lantos, the only member of the House of Representatives who was a Holocaust survivor. He and his staff were hugely supportive of my passion for civil rights and it managed to keep my feet in the area of politics while I also worked at my second job – at Victoria’s Secret. I started as a part-time holiday hire and was quickly promoted to credit and bra specialist lead before becoming a co-manager.           You may wonder what politics and lingerie have in common. I always sum it up as, “You have to make someone want something they don’t need and want to pay too much for it.”            My boss at Victoria’s Secret had grown up next door to a family of little people who had offered her stability in a childhood that had little, so it was nice to not have to go into a job where I’d have to prove myself just as capable as a nondisabled person. I think being a person with a physical disability working at the most image conscious company in the world actually made me more approachable to a lot of customers and also made me want to help folks who may have felt nervous or uncomfortable in the store.            I think the funniest thing was how customers would describe me when checking out. They’d actively fumble their words and body around trying to describe me without saying I was a little person. “Ummmmm, the girl in the black suit.” (We all wore black suits). “Well, she’s petite.” (There were a number of us who were.) My sales associates were comfortable with me being a little person but the customers were very concerned about being rude or just not knowing what to say in general.            The experience did make me more conscious about my safety, because I had a few strange customers who would follow me around in the store or who would act like they were “fascinated” with me. One couple in particular went too far and made a point of repeatedly telling me, “We could pick you up and walk out with you. We’d take you home and make you a button in our mattress. No one could physically stop us.” I think as a little person you tend to get a heightened “spidey sense” because of how people treat you, and that experience definitely set mine off. But on the whole my customers were kind and thankful for my help.            Doing political and public policy work was still my dream, though, and in 2004, I moved to Washington to take a job working in education policy. A mentor of mine persuaded me to come and work for the National Collaborative on Workforce and Disability/Youth. I learned a ton working there, and it was there that I also met my amazing husband, Patrick. He says he noticed me right away – cautioning himself not to come off as creepy by “staring at the new girl.” I have no memory of this.            Today, our family exists at multiple crossroads.           Patrick is average height and African-American. I’m a little person. Our two kids are both little people. My husband has a vision impairment, so I’m the driver in the family, but, usually, new average-height people we meet assume he’s the driver. Like many D.C. couples, we met at work.           When having our own children, it was interesting how our friends reacted to our news. Our LP (that’s how those of us in the community refer to “little people”) friends all automatically assumed the baby would be a little person; we see it as a marker of cultural pride. Our average height friends didn’t ask me about whether the baby would be LP or average height – they’d ask Patrick, and he would typically respond that he didn’t care either way.           I worked at the White House when I was pregnant and had our first child, Jackson. To him, it was routine to head back to the office with me after pickup so I could keep working. In Barack Obama’s White House, it never felt weird or out-of-place being the mother of African-American kids with disabilities who were on a first-name basis with senior White House officials. To quote the boss himself, “I believe that this country succeeds when everyone gets a fair shot, when everyone does their fair share, when everyone plays by the same rules.” And those are really the values that we stress as we’re raising Jackson and his younger sister, Kaya.           At age 6, Jackson’s awareness of the world is growing. One day, he came home from kindergarten and said, “Mom, you’re white, Dad’s black, and I’m peach.” His dad turned around and said “Peach? You’re black.” Jackson pointed to his arm, shook his head, and said “Peach!” This made us realize that we needed to discuss our kids and their heritage much more than we had been.           We’ve purposely stayed in the D.C. area because there is a thriving chapter of Little People of America here and I want my children to grow up with a strong tie to that community. It’s  important for them to have friends who are other LPs, have teen and young adult LPs to look up to, and to know LP adults.           Since we’re raising children who also identify as African-American, it is imperative to Patrick and me that they have strong people in the black community to look up to and relate to. We are blessed with a cadre of aunties and uncles and cousins who are biological and chosen family members from my husband’s childhood, his time at Howard University, and our various circles of friends. As a white woman, I have to be aware that my daughter in particular is going to have questions that I can’t – and in some cases, shouldn’t – be the one to answer.           As a professional advocate, I’ve spent the last few years working on issues tied to police killings of African-Americans with disabilities. Unarmed people of color whose names you may know because their deaths involved the police – Eric Garner, Natasha McKinnon, Sandra Bland – were also all people with disabilities, many of whom disclosed their disabilities to law enforcement and still died.           Raising two African-American children with disabilities, I understand that some of the very qualities that endear them to people now – their curiosity, their feeling that they’ve never met a stranger, their trust in the world – could be the very same things that could potentially put them in danger. So we have to talk about these things, because while the bubble of our home provides safety and security, the outside world is a different place.           My children have grown up knowing chosen family members who have been assaulted by law enforcement. It broke my heart to have to talk to my son about this, but we also couldn’t keep it from him.           When the anesthesiologist suggested that my doctor sterilize me, what I heard was someone with medical authority basically telling another person with medical authority that I shouldn’t be having any more children. I was certainly angry, but not surprised. Many of us in the disability community know this feeling all too well. Whether it’s forced sterilization, experimentation, eugenics, or treatments to keep us small and manageable, removing our right to control our bodies, our personhood, has been common practice by the “well-meaning” nondisabled public for centuries.           No amount of education, of mentors, or of amazingly supportive workplaces would have prepared me for this level of discrimination. Yet this is what many disabled people encounter as parents.           Under the law in dozens of states, children can be removed from their homes based solely on a parent’s disability. In my work as an advocate, I’ve spoken with a dyslexic mom who lost her kids when pharmacists thought she would misread instructions and overmedicate them, and a father who lost his kids when a ball rolled into the street and he wheeled his chair to the curb, always in control, to help the kid retrieve it and a neighbor saw.           If not denied personhood outright, we tend to get our personhood policed by rhetoric and language.  Nondisabled people routinely refer to us using euphemisms like “special needs,” “differently abled,” or, in a pun on language from the past, “handi-capable.”           These aren’t words anyone like me (meaning disabled) came up with – they were defined by society because the concept of “disability” makes nondisabled people feel uncomfortable. It’s a reminder that yes, we are different.           But as I like to remind people, disability is written into civil rights laws, so by teaching young people that “disability” is something to be ashamed of – say, by implying that someone shouldn’t have more children because of one – society is, in fact, disconnecting them from their civil rights.  We didn’t celebrate the 27th anniversary of the “Americans with Special Needs Act” this summer, after all.           The disability community continues to struggle with media and interest-group narratives that frame us as victims or takers. The ongoing health care fight by the disability-rights group ADAPT – with its images of Americans in wheelchairs protesting proposed cuts to Medicaid and being removed by Capitol Police – and others was a powerful moment in our movement. And while the public reacted with outrage at disabled people being abused by law enforcement, I have to wonder if nondisabled people really knew just what the protesters with disabilities, including our friend Steph Woodward, whose image became synonymous with this activism for a time, were really fighting for.           They were fighting for their very lives, their right to determine where they wanted to live – in this case, in their communities rather than being forcibly institutionalized in nursing homes. They are strong, but were still fighting and being framed as victims.            We talk about this a lot in our home, about the issues affecting the intersecting oppressions we encounter, whether ableism, racism or sexism. It’s impossible not to – and we would be irresponsible if we didn’t.           We also spend a lot of time talking to my kids about consent. People often act as though disabled people don’t have a right to bodily autonomy. When I attended the women’s march in D.C. in January, I was repeatedly grabbed and manhandled by women who wanted to know where was my mommy and why didn’t I know better than to wander away from her. They all looked shocked when I responded, “I am the mommy,” but not a single one apologized to me.     Sign up for our new newsletter.Join us on Twitter and Facebook         As little people, we also deal with the public taking photos and videos of us without our consent. I want my children to understand how to navigate the world safely but at the same time feel like they can speak up when someone is treating them wrong or in a way that makes them uncomfortable.           Patrick and I are now expecting our third child. As of yet, we don’t know if he will be a little person or an average height child, though so far, it looks like he will be the latter. But we don’t care either way.           What matters to us, as we anticipate the joy and sleepless nights ahead, is that our family is growing again.

opinion,"Single, childless and nearing 40, I saw one real option",https://www.cnn.com/2017/04/25/opinions/ivf-3-7-percent-opinion-lenti/index.html," Editor’s Note: Sarah Lenti is a political strategist and policy advisor at SML Advisory Partners. She served as a director on the National Security Council under Condoleezza Rice and worked as a lead researcher for Mitt Romney’s 2010 book, “No Apology: The Case for American Greatness.”  The views expressed in this commentary are her own. This piece is the first of a CNN Opinion series, “What it’s like to be me,” which explores the personal struggles Americans face at a time of profound social change.   Top Republican strategist Sarah Lenti details how — against her family's wishes and conservative values —  she decided to undergo IVF to become a single parent After being told she had less than a 5% chance of conceiving -- 3.7% in fact -- she gave birth to two baby boys, Eli and Abel.        It was a year ago when a young woman stopped me in a neighborhood shop. She gazed at my stroller and started crying. She told me how lucky I was to be married with kids.           My heart dropped. She didn’t know me at all.           I am a single mother by choice. Yet I was raised in a Christian, conservative home, where I grew up believing in the traditional family unit. And I was taught that there was an order to achieving it. First, fall in love. Second, marry a man. Third, start a family.           Now in my fifth decade, only one has proven true for me – and it isn’t the first.           On the day that I turned 30, I journaled that I would think about becoming a mother should I still be single at 38. What that looked like, I didn’t exactly know. It was a promise to myself, maybe to God.           At the time, I was in a terrible relationship with a man who told me he wanted to be with me, but he could never love me. It was because of those words that I first clung to the idea of motherhood. Maybe a man could deny me love, but he would never deny me a child.           Fast forward to my 38th birthday. I was still single, and the world of dating had changed significantly in the last eight years. Tinder and Bumble, the dominant dating apps, offered countless options for single men and women, but made the experience of dating entirely impersonal.     Every family is different: Share your story of how IVF, adoption or your unique family structure has shaped your life with #ToBeMe or text/WhatsApp us on +1-347-322-0415         Dating amounted to small talk with a stranger, who you had briefly interfaced with online because you each thought the other attractive. The small talk was a prelude to hooking up, and there were no expectations even of a text the next day.           It was brutal. And after trying my hand at it, I was no closer to finding the love of my life or starting a family.             If I needed statistics to back me up, I had them. In 2014, marriage was on the decline, as was the fertility rate in the United States.           I had one real option left – and that was to attempt to get pregnant alone.            Maybe I didn’t deserve a family, or so many of the subscribers to my conservative Christian values might say. And maybe the men with whom I had been involved didn’t view me as acceptable wife/mother material.            But deep down I felt differently and decided to give myself one shot.           And so I started the process of in vitro fertilization (IVF). I was mentally prepared for the physical havoc that would ensue, and I had saved every penny for it – to the tune of $30,000.              Tinder and Bumble, the dominant dating apps, offered countless options for single men and women, but made the experience of dating entirely impersonal.               But why didn’t I adopt? After all, even if I were fortunate enough to have a child, the child would be fatherless. And many, myself included, believe this places the child in a precarious situation.            That said, at least with IVF my potential child would be biologically related to me, his or her grandparents and cousins. The child might not have a father, but he or she would have a strong bloodline.  I hoped this would help ease any future struggle for my child.           The very decade I was born into – the glorious 70’s – ushered in the science and technology that might allow me to conceive. Alone.           More specifically, 1978 was the year that the first human being was born through the process of embryo creation outside of the womb, then implantation inside of the womb, pregnancy and successful birth. Since that time, IVF has produced approximately 5 million babies, with nearly 1 million of those being born in the United States.           The IVF pool is quite minuscule compared to total US births – for example, in 2011, only 0.7% of all US births were attributed to IVF. That said, and barely optimistic, I was committed to the process, or so I thought.           And yet there I was  at a bar in Los Angeles, a month out from IVF, crying in front of two people I barely knew, but knew well enough to unload to.           My life was great on paper. I had done all the right things. I went to Stanford for graduate school. I worked at the White House under Condoleezza Rice. I had the opportunity to travel the world. I had loving parents and two wonderful sisters.           And yet I felt unloved – even unlovable. And also greatly conflicted.           On the one hand, I was ecstatic – I was weeks away from my shot at becoming a biological mom. I started thinking about this potential path nine years ago and had been setting aside money for five years. I was in love with idea of having a family and giddy at the thought of the unknown.           But there was doubt. Goodness, there was doubt. There was that little voice inside my head – the voice of my parents and others – that was very much alive in me. “Why would you purposely bring a child into the world without a father? Are you really that lonely? How would that child feel one day?”           Throughout my upbringing, I was told that it’s wrong to play God. And, as recently as the previous Christmas Eve, I was told that bringing a child into the world without a father was selfish.           My heart and my brain had to fight back.           No, I was not that lonely. No, I was not that selfish.  Actually, it was waking up single, every single day of my life – only to be greeted by my career – that felt selfish. And while I could never speak for the feelings that my future child might have, I took solace in the belief that any child would be happy to be alive if he or she were sincerely loved.             Throughout my upbringing, I was told that it’s wrong to play God. And, as recently as the previous Christmas Eve, I was told that bringing a child into the world without a father was selfish.               As I drew nearer to the implantation date, the prospect of creating a tiny human grew more real and began to override any lingering doubt.           And so, on August 29, 2014, I asked my doctor to implant two embryos. He wisely asked me to justify two. I was quick to answer. If I were lucky enough to get pregnant with twins – what a gift for them. They may not have a father, but they would always have each other.           I knew the statistics and did not expect to get pregnant. Given my age and the means of conception, I was praying for the long shot of one, knowing two would be a miracle.           The 2014 Assisted Reproductive Technology National Summary Report, as published by the US Department of Health and Human Services, is a humbling reminder of just how small the odds were during the year that I attempted to conceive. In 2014, a woman of my age, using fresh non-donor eggs with no previous pregnancies, had an 18.8% chance of pregnancy resulting in a live birth. When it came to percentages of cycles resulting in twin lives births, the success rate plummeted to 3.7%.           Yes, I had a 3.7% chance of success.           Of course, before the IVF process could begin, I had to choose a donor – and let’s just say I took a less than conventional approach.            Given my professional background as a conservative politico, I think people expect me to say that IQ, number of educational degrees and political association were at the top of my donor qualifications list. Not the case.           I was looking for someone who I would be attracted to if we were procreating in the traditional way.           I know this must sound incredibly superficial. But, let’s be frank, it’s impossible to gauge true intellect or a kind heart by virtue of an online donor search.           And so I began my search with a focus on the physical attributes that I have always been attracted to – namely height and athleticism. Six-foot-2 and toned was my baseline.           The donor was a collegiate lacrosse athlete. I was able to see three pictures, from tot to teen, of an adorable boy with an incredible smile, unruly hair and a twinkle in his eyes. (This particular bank did not allow adult pictures of the donor for legal reasons. So, at the end of the day, the attraction part of my search was also a gamble.)                I was searching for my version of good genes, who also looks good in jeans – at least on paper.                I finished my search on the scientific side of things. The donor bank I chose provided a full medical history and genetic testing results. Honestly, why wouldn’t you opt for a donor with no heart disease, cancer, mental illness or any other serious genetic conditions in his family history?           This is the one distinct advantage of going the donor route as opposed to the good old-fashioned route when conceiving. While I haven’t polled my married or attached friends, I am 99.9% certain that not a single one queried their partner about the specifics of their family’s medical history prior to sleeping with them or accepting a marriage proposal.           I was searching for my version of good genes, who also looks good in jeans – at least on paper.           In early September, my blood work came back with hormone levels signaling pregnancy. I was in shock, but I had eight long weeks to go until seeing if there was a heartbeat or two. I started to take a pregnancy test every evening. It was the longest 56 days of my life.           D-Day finally arrived. And, there on the sonogram screen right in front of me, was the most beautiful thing: my child’s heartbeat, strong and steady.           I had a million immediate questions for the sonographer and started right in. She stopped me, because there was heartbeat number two. Wait, what? I was laughing and crying at the same time. This must be what joy feels like, I thought.           The cliché that I despise most is: It will happen when you least expect it. Nonsense. I had gone almost 40 years expecting nothing in terms of dating, love and, God forbid, a husband – and I received exactly that in return.           But suddenly the least expected had happened. I was pregnant with twins.            My journal entry from the evening read as follows:     Week 8, Day 1: October 6th D Day   Dear God: Thank you.   Baby A: your heartbeat was 159 today.   Baby B: your heartbeat was 168.   I love you A & B.  Please keep growing. You’re looking great.   Thank you, God. I pray for their development – from their fingers to their toes. From brain to nose. I am so grateful for these precious beings. Prepare me to be the strong parent – fiscally and spiritually – that they will need me to be.   Love you.         On a Friday morning roughly 30 weeks after implantation, something seemed wrong. I had such severe leg cramps that I was crawling around the apartment on my hands and knees. I called an Uber at 8:30 am. Never having taken any birthing classes, I had no idea what the onset of labor looked like.             By the time I got to the hospital the pain was so intense that I could barely make it to the door. The Uber driver offered to help me up. I was immediately checked in and within minutes was told that I was 7 cm dilated and would be headed into an emergency C-section.           My heart stopped. I was petrified that those little heartbeats were going to stop and that my sons – my sons – were not going to make it. I was alone in the pre-delivery room just long enough to run through every awful scenario in my head.           And then it was time. Seventy minutes after arrival, I was wheeled into a room with a team of 16 doctors and nurses waiting for me. The sight of this army, the two waiting incubators and all the other metal contraptions made me well up. I had no idea what was going to happen next, but I had never expected it to happen quite like this – not this early, not with these many medical professionals and not entirely on my own.             Eli and Abel have proven to be the embodiment of that saying you always hear – the hardest, yet best thing I’ve ever done.                 Doctors and nurses were working quickly all around me. Epidural, check. Babies’ heart rates, check. Slicing me open, check. Ripping two crimson-colored sons out of me at 10:40 am and 10:43 am, check and check.           I saw Eli and Abel for a nanosecond before the nurses cut the cords and rushed them to their incubator stations to begin inserting the breathing tubes. They were 10 weeks premature and neither could suck, swallow or breathe on their own.           The two teams whisked my babies to the Level 4 NICU (neonatal intensive care unit) without me getting to touch their skin or ask if their vital signs were stable. I did hear them cry, which was a relief.  I just wish my sisters had been there to take a picture and help recount what happened. I can’t ever get that moment back.            Little did I know when I moved to Denver that I would be delivering twins two years later at Denver’s premier NICU hospital – The Rocky Mountain Hospital for Children at Presbyterian St. Luke’s           I was not able to see my sons until nine very long hours after delivery. I walked into a room with two incubators housing my baby boys, who looked more like starved squirrels than the roly-poly infants that I had envisioned. All wired up, with IVs jutting out of the top of their skulls, they were absolutely perfect. Complete miracles from inception to emergency birth.           And, of course, they chose Friday the 13th of March to scare the living hell out of me and fight their way onto this Earth.           Two weeks after I was released from the hospital, I found myself sleeping in my Denver home of almost two years, as my boys lived and slept inside NICU – for 60 days straight.            And though I could easily have felt alone – so removed from my two miracles – I didn’t.            Friends and family from across the country constantly checked in on me, calling, texting, writing me words of encouragement.            And even once Eli and Abel were out of NICU, loving and supporting friends – and sometimes even strangers –continued to shower us with kindness and affection.           Initially, the NICU team was our rock. These complete strangers became the most significant and consequential people in the lives of my sons during their first two months. I will never be able to appropriately express my gratitude to the nurses and doctors who safeguarded their lives. Several are friends to this day.           Then my personal trainer and his wife, the first people to visit me in the hospital, became the most trusted and consistent presence in our lives. From celebrating our birthdays, to helping with our apartment move, to Fourth of July and Super Bowl celebrations, to just being those adult ears that I need – Adam and Teri have been there for all of it.             You wake up every morning with a mandate and desire to be a better parent to your children than you were the day before.               The mother of twin boys, who lived steps away from me, became my sanity check. We were pregnant at the same time and delivered within weeks of each other. We met by fluke, thanks to a double stroller sighting in the alley.           And the parents of my first employee proved invaluable, babysitting the boys on weekends so I could nap.           I can’t forget the British transplant, who regularly delivered homemade quiche on weeknights just because.           More recently, though, the manager at the Palm (steakhouse) took care of my family. It was Thanksgiving night, and I took the twins for our first holiday fête as a family of three. In one of the most random acts of kindness, the manager worked her way to our table, poured me a glass of wine, helped feed the boys, shared a bit of her life story with me and then bought our meal. She did not know me.           Most importantly, since the birth of Eli and Abel, my parents have fallen so completely in love with their grandsons that it’s hard to fully put into words the intensity of their connection. What was at first an idea hard for my traditional parents to grasp, is now two, tiny human beings, who have my parents tightly wrapped around their little fingers. Though thousands of miles away, my parents – and my sisters – express their love and support constantly and in innumerable ways.           There are incredible people in this world. My sons’ existences have made that real to me.           Eli and Abel have proven to be the embodiment of that saying you always hear – the hardest, yet best thing I’ve ever done.           My sons are my family and my future. They represent everything good, hopeful and hilarious about life. They smile and cheer when I walk into their room. They blow kisses and sneak hugs. They belly laugh when we dance. They cuddle up at night and put their heads in the crook of my neck.           They also scream, bite and bang their heads on the floor when they’re upset. They chuck their food when they don’t like it. They act like the world is coming to an end at bath time. And they are a constant financial stress.  Being a single parent is hard as hell.           But from my two little men, I quickly internalized that love is a verb. Love is an action and something you work at every single day. You wake up every morning with a mandate and desire to be a better parent to your children than you were the day before.             They are my miracles, which I almost didn’t allow to happen because of heartbreak, self-doubt and maybe even self-loathing.               Speaking of love, friends like to tell me that there is a man out there – some wonderful man who will sweep me off my feet and be an excellent father. To that I say, please stop. Do I want to date? Of course. But I can honestly write that I have no expectations for love, and I certainly do not believe that there is a father out there for my sons. I am not waiting and hoping, because I have lost that hope.           Why have I lost that hope? Truth be told, I have been vulnerable with a few men pre- and post-pregnancy. But rejection upon rejection by man after man will do it to you. Even when you are that aloof gal, who doesn’t ask questions or have expectations of something real or long-term, it still ends. I guess you just lose your luster after awhile. It’s my reality, and it never changes.           And while we are on the topic of relationships, I would note that I will forever be perplexed by the rate of unsolicited and unexpected congratulatory communications from ex-boyfriends after years of no contact. These were the men who rejected me. These were the men who left after months or years of pretending and/or cheating.       Mom writes children's book to explain IVF to her son         After the birth of my sons, these same men suddenly thought they had a green card to strike up conversation and ask for pictures of the twins. One suggested grabbing dinner in DC. One kindly offered to come to Colorado to help run errands, cook dinner or do whatever I needed.             The attention was hard to digest. I once cried over these men. Perhaps this was a way of absolving their guilt for being dishonest or wasting my time? Perhaps they were sincerely happy for me, which would suggest that they did respect me after all? Perhaps they were feeling slighted or envious that I went it alone, without them? I’ll never know.            And, most importantly, I finally no longer care.           Though I may never have a significant other, I do have my sons, who’ve taken me from unloved to loved and from unlovable to lovable. They’ve done this all on their own. They are my miracles, which I almost didn’t allow to happen because of heartbreak, self-doubt and maybe even self-loathing.           Prior to Eli and Abel, I wasted at least half of my adult life obsessing about things I had lost – men who broke my heart, clients who weren’t a good fit, friendships that had faded.            My sons taught me to focus on the miracles that are right in front of my eyes every single day, beginning with my 3.7%.

opinion,"We asked, you answered: How IVF and adoption changed your lives",https://www.cnn.com/2017/04/28/opinions/opinions-ivf-adoption-reaction/index.html,"       On Tuesday, CNN Opinion published “Single, childless and nearing 40, I saw one real option,” a personal essay by Sarah Lenti, a political strategist who decided to have children through in vitro fertilization (IVF).  She writes: “I am a single mother by choice. Yet I was raised in a Christian, conservative home, where I grew up believing in the traditional family unit. And I was taught that there was an order to achieving it. First, fall in love. Second, marry a man. Third, start a family. Now in my fifth decade, only one has proven true for me – and it isn’t the first.”            Lenti’s piece was the first of a CNN Opinion series, “What it’s like to be me,” which explores personal struggles Americans face in a time of social change.           We asked you, CNN’s audience, to share your stories of IVF and adoption through text message and WhatsApp – and you responded with personal experiences that were as various as they were emotionally compelling.           You shared with us stories of your joys and your struggles. You shared family photos – and some of you even sent us videos about your families’ journeys. Here they are.            “The article I just read in CNN on a single mom by choice hit home. My daughter just turned 1 and I too began this journey a little less than two years ago. I will be 38 in May and I always wanted a family. I dated someone long-term and when that relationship ended, by the time I finished licking my wounds, I was 36 with no prospects. I went on every online dating site and never met anyone worth my time. I decided to give insemination a try. I conceived relatively quickly. It was the best decision for me. I know another friend who went this route and after sharing my story many more friends are interested in becoming single moms by choice. It’s not that I don’t want a partner, I just didn’t want my opportunity to become a mother to pass me by in the meantime.           “(The article) made me happy to know that more women are not afraid to say how they conceived their babies outside of “traditional relationships.” That we are taking control of our lives, our fertility and bringing babies into this world that are wanted and loved before they are even conceived.”           “Blessed and fortunate to have my own modern family thanks to surrogacy.            “Our dream of having a baby started in 2014, the year we got married. We found a surrogacy agency in an IVF practice in Connecticut. We were matched with our first surrogate in 2015 and she got pregnant right away, but sadly she had a miscarriage at eight-and-a-half weeks. We were devastated and upset, naturally, but we knew we didn’t want to give up because we really wanted to have a baby. So we waited and we tried again and were matched with another surrogate in 2016 and she also got pregnant right away, but this time she carried the baby to 38-and-a-half weeks and we had Chelsea.           “We feel really lucky and fortunate to have Chelsea because we know how difficult it can be to have a baby in untraditional ways. Even if you have all the means and resources necessary that doesn’t always guarantee a baby. “           “My name is Jo Zmood. I am a single mum of two now. Originally from Australia – hence “mum” not “mom.” I’ve lived in New York for 10 years, and while there are many books out there that talk about different types of families I couldn’t quite find the right book to share with my son to provide him some explanation of my choice to bring him into this world alone. So I wrote my own story for him. The article inspired me to share it.           “He never asked any questions and understands some of his friends have dads and some don’t. I wanted to answer his question of why he doesn’t, regardless of whether the question is posed. And to let him know the subject was not taboo.”           “During the three years I struggled to get pregnant with my second child as a solo parent, people close to me asked if I should consider the failed pregnancies a sign to give up. I was not giving up. The years of navigating fibroid tumors, surgeries and infertility finally came to an end with the birth of my second son, Oliver. He was born with my eggs and the help of my cousin as my surrogate. My journey as a solo parent also ended when I met my husband right before learning my surrogate was pregnant with Oliver. We were both solo parents in our 40s and had never been married before. Our journey to building a family may not have taken a typical path, but what we have today is my dream come true.”            Kim Overton writes about her experience on her website.

My ex-husband couldn’t have children either so we adopted two babies within three years. The marriage ended a few years later and I remarried the following year. My new husband and I started our married life with two 4-year-olds and a 2-year-old.           “Then the surprises came. I had babies at age 35, 39, and 46 – – all conceived the old-fashioned way!”           “I am a US-Belgian dual citizen, single mom, living in Brussels After many failed attempts (albeit fun) at a real relationship, I decided to have a child on my own. Having a supportive family, especially my sister living in Belgium, was one of the reasons I did not hesitate to go solo.           “When the adoption agency called me saying that they had received the picture of my daughter, I ran to go see her photo.           “After an exhausting trip, arrived late into the night in Changsha, capital of the Hunan province, we went to the office of child affairs, or something of the sort, and each waited until we were called and they brought the babies out one by one. I looked at her as they were putting her in my arms, the most amazing and unreal feeling possible. She cried right away and I put a pacifier in her mouth and it calmed her right away.           “What I remember most, is putting her on a chair in the hotel room and just staring at this little bundle of baby and saying, I cannot believe she is mine! The wait had not been too long (seven months for China to pair me up with Lynne and from the start of the process of first meeting with the agency to the file being sent was about 12 months, so all in all, about one-and-a-half years – so not too long).”           “She got attached to me immediately and when we were in the dining hall, I could not even leave her in her buggy to get food, she had to come with me and see me. The nannies had told me that she was always crawling behind one or the other person at the orphanage so she had to be in someone’s company at all times.           “She still does not like being alone! She loves being close to me and needs company to be happy, even if now, as a teen, she can spend hours in her room doing who knows what! I call her my little pot of glue.           “Adopting is not easy. I mean being a single mom, making all the decisions, is hard. And having a smart child, ahead of her years for some things, is challenging to say the least. Also, an abandoned child’s brain develops differently and this is why sometimes, they rebel against us and make life very hard. They try, albeit unconsciously, to do all they can to push us away. They are repeating the abandonment they felt as a child. But you have to hold fast, hold on and show you are always there. But it’s tough when they bite and scratch and break things, kick you etc … But with the help of family, psychologists and relational therapy, you get it done. And now, although she’s a typical teenager, we have a lot of good times.           “What she wants the most is spending time with me, so when we can, we travel. We’ve been to Burkina Faso,  Mexico, China (went back to do some volunteer teaching for 3 months in 2009 near Qingdao), all over Europe, California, New York, Atlanta, South Carolina, Boston, Cuba … She has a map on her wall with pins of all the places she’s been. We’d like to go to Japan next!           “All in all, being a mom is the toughest job. It is also the most rewarding. I do not know how they decide which parent gets which child in China, but I would not have wanted any other. It had to be her, no one else. I love her with all my heart. And I do get the love back. Those few moments when she shows her love with no boundaries are worth all the pain I go through to be her mom. I’d do it all the same if I had to. Would not change a thing!”           “We have the most beautiful miracle from IVF. Go Science! I’m a Chinese dentist, mom is a Hispanic dietitian.

opinion,What happened when my dad met a bully,https://www.cnn.com/2021/01/22/opinions/trump-bullying-and-fear-bardsley/index.html," Editor’s Note: Greg Bardsley is the author of the novels “Cash Out” (2012) and “The Bob Watson” (2016) from HarperCollins Publishers. A former columnist and speechwriter, he lives in the San Francisco Bay area. The opinions expressed in this commentary are his own. View more opinion on CNN.         As a child, my dad was so small that people called him Minnow.           His size often invited teasing, ridicule and bullying. One day in grade school, it culminated with an older (and much larger) bully challenging my dad to a fight in front of everyone after school.           As my dad would tell me, his stomach was tied in knots for the rest of the day. He didn’t want to fight, and he knew that if he did fight, he almost certainly would get beat up. Hounded by giddy classmates all day — “Minnow, what are you gonna do?” — my dad told them that he would show up for the fight. He knew that if he cowed, the bully would be emboldened and things for everyone would only get worse.           Frothy excitement engulfed the school as news spread that Minnow would fight the bully. Finally, the school bell rang, and my dad walked to the specified location, followed by a throng of curious classmates. Fear gripped him.     If there's anyone who can reach a deal, it's Joe Biden         When my dad finally arrived, the bully wasn’t there.           My dad waited. And waited.            The bully never showed.           My dad said he learned an important lesson that day. For bullies, fear and intimidation is their oxygen. Fear and intimidation give them power. And while some bullies will fight, a great many more are relying on you to cower — it is the secret of their power.           As things turned out, “Mellow Minnow,” as he was known, would later become a Golden Gloves boxer and would finish his career as one of the top flyweights in the United States. He said that during the Korean War, a few larger GIs made the mistake of trying to push him around.            Most people who knew my dad would never have guessed this part of his history –— that the affable, kind, quiet and self-deprecating Iowa native with bifocals and a comb-over was once a fighter, and that he would stand up for himself, for others and for what was right, if needed.     I went to Washington for joy, and Amanda Gorman delivered it         Ever since the Trump mob followed the call of their leader and descended on the Capitol on January 6, I have thought a lot about the parallels of my dad’s story and the fears many of us have felt.           Some members of Congress reportedly voted against electoral certification on January 6 because they were afraid for their physical safety. MAGA bullies threatened to descend on state capitals with more violence. They threatened to attack Washington, DC. They showed us their guns and hatred. Fear ensued, and some argued that this week’s presidential inauguration should be moved indoors. Others suggested that we should “go easy” on the insurrectionists so as not to trigger more terror and violence.           Instead, people decided to stand up to the bullies.            In recent weeks, hundreds of domestic terrorists have been arrested. People across the political spectrum have stepped up and identified radicalized friends or family members who participated in the insurrection. Ten Republicans joined Democrats in impeaching our top bully, despite numerous death threats from the mob he egged on.      If Biden wants to fix health care, he will need Republicans         Local and state Republicans have been recognized for refusing to be bullied into overturning election results in their communities. Even the losing vice president refused to leave the Capitol during the January 6 insurrection, determined to execute his duty and protect our democracy even as the MAGA mob hunted for him in the Capitol, chanting, “Hang Mike Pence.”            More than 25,000 soldiers arrived in Washington DC, to face any bullies who might show up with their guns, swastikas, Confederate flags and bully clubs. And this week President Biden took the oath of office outdoors, right where the attempted coup had unfolded only fourteen days earlier. People faced their fears, and they ensured the orderly and democratic transfer of power.           People stood up to the bullies, who never showed up. That includes our top bully, who chose to flee town.      Join us on Twitter and Facebook         This week we are reminded that fear and intimidation are diminished when people come together and stand up to the bullies. We have learned that there are enough leaders (and citizens) who will not appease — because history tells us that appeasing fascists, thugs and bullies never works. People stood up for what was right, and the bullies lost a bit of their dark power.           I wasn’t planning on sharing the story of my late father.

health,How lawmakers in Texas and Florida undermine Covid vaccination efforts,https://edition.cnn.com/2023/11/10/health/some-states-curtail-covid-vaccination-efforts/index.html,"       Katherine Wells wants to urge her Lubbock, Texas, community to get vaccinated against Covid-19. “That could really save people from severe illness,” said Wells, the city’s public health director.           But she can’t.           A rule added to Texas’ budget that went into effect Sept. 1 forbids health departments and other organizations funded by the state government to advertise, recommend, or even list covid vaccines alone. “Clinics may inform patients that COVID-19 vaccinations are available,” the rule allows, “if it is not being singled out from other vaccines.”           Texas isn’t the only state curtailing the public conversation about Covid vaccines. Tennessee’s health department homepage, for example, features the flu, vaping, and cancer screening but leaves out Covid and Covid vaccines. Florida is an extreme case, where the health department has issued guidance against Covid vaccines that runs counter to scientific studies and advice from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.           Notably, the shift in health information trails rhetoric from primarily Republican politicians who have reversed their positions on covid vaccines. Fierce opposition to measures like masking and business closures early in the pandemic fueled a mistrust of the CDC and other scientific institutions and often falls along party lines: Last month, a KFF poll found that 84% of Democrats said they were confident in the safety of covid vaccines, compared with 36% of Republicans. It’s a dramatic drop from 2021, when two-thirds of Republicans were vaccinated.     Health misinformation and lack of confidence in vaccines continue to grow, years after the Covid-19 pandemic, survey shows         As new vaccines roll out ahead of the expected winter surge of Covid, some health officials are treading carefully to avoid blowback from the public and policymakers. So far, vaccine uptake is low, with less than 5% of Americans receiving an updated shot, according to the Department of Health and Human Services. Wells fears the consequences will be dire: “We will see a huge disparity in health outcomes because of changes in language.”           A study published in July found that Republicans and Democrats in Ohio and Florida died at roughly similar rates before Covid vaccines emerged, but a disparity between parties grew once the first vaccines were widely available in 2021 and uptake diverged. By year’s end, Republicans had a 43% higher rate of excess deaths than Democrats.           Public health initiatives have long been divisive — water fluoridation, needle exchanges, and universal health care, to name a few. But the pandemic turned up the volume to painful levels, public health officials say. More than 500 left their jobs under duress in 2020 and 2021, and legislators in at least 26 states passed laws to prevent public officials from setting health policies. Republican Arkansas state Sen. Trent Garner told KFF Health News in 2021, “It’s time to take the power away from the so-called experts.”           At first, vaccine mandates were contentious but the shots themselves were not. Scott Rivkees, Florida’s former surgeon general, now at Brown University, traces the shift to the months after Joe Biden was elected president. Though Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis initially promoted Covid vaccination, his stance changed as resistance to Covid measures became central to his presidential campaign. In late 2021, he appointed Joseph Ladapo surgeon general. By then, Ladapo had penned Wall Street Journal op-eds skeptical of mainstream medical advice, such as one asking, “Are Covid Vaccines Riskier Than Advertised?”           As bivalent boosters rolled out last year, the Florida health department’s homepage removed information on Covid vaccines. In its place were rules against mandates and details on how to obtain vaccine exemptions. Then, early this year, the department advised against vaccinating children and teens.     Why you shouldn’t postpone your flu vaccine         The state’s advice changed once more when the CDC recommended updated covid vaccines in September. DeSantis incorrectly said the vaccines had “not been proven to be safe or effective.” And the health department amended its guidance to say men under age 40 should not be vaccinated because the department had conducted research and deemed the risk of heart complications like myocarditis unacceptable. It refers to a short, authorless document posted online rather than in a scientific journal where it would have been vetted for accuracy. The report uses an unusual method to analyze health records of vaccinated Floridians. Citing serious flaws, most other researchers call it misinformation.           Scientifically vetted studies, and the CDC’s own review, contradict Florida’s conclusion against vaccination. Cases of myocarditis following mRNA vaccines have occurred but are much less frequent than cases triggered by covid. The risk is sevenfold higher from the disease than from mRNA vaccines, according to an analysis published in a medical journal based on a review of 22 other studies.           Since leaving his post, Rivkees has been stunned to see the state health department subsumed by political meddling.           About 28,700 children and adults from birth to age 39 have died of Covid in the United States. Florida’s anti-vaccine messaging affects people of all ages, Rivkees added, not just those who are younger.           He points out that Florida performed well compared with other states in 2020 and 2021, ranking 38th in Covid deaths per capita despite a large population of older adults. Now it has the sixth-highest rate of Covid deaths in the country.           “There is no question that the rise of misinformation and the politicization of the response has taken a toll on public health,” he said.           As in Florida, the Texas health department initially promoted Covid vaccines, warning that Texans who weren’t vaccinated were about 20 times as likely to suffer a Covid-associated death. Such sentiments faded last year, as state leaders passed policies to block vaccine mandates and other public health measures. The latest is a prohibition against the use of government funds to promote Covid vaccines. Uptake in Texas is already low, with fewer than 4% of residents getting the bivalent booster that rolled out last year.

At Lubbock’s health department, Wells managed to put out a press release saying the city offers Covid vaccines but stopped short of recommending them. “We aren’t able to do as big a push as other states,” she said.           Some health officials are altering their recommendations, given the current climate. Janet Hamilton, executive director at the Council of State and Territorial Epidemiologists, said clear-cut advice to get vaccinated against Covid works when people trust the scientific establishment, but it risks driving others away from all vaccines. “It’s important for public health to meet people where they are,” Hamilton said.           Missouri’s health department took this tack on X, formerly known as Twitter: “COVID vaccines will be available in Missouri soon, if you’re in to that sort of thing. If not, just keep scrolling!”     KFF Health News, formerly known as Kaiser Health News (KHN), is a national newsroom that produces in-depth journalism about health issues and is one of the core operating programs at KFF — the independent source for health policy research, polling, and journalism.  © 2023 Cable News Network.

health,CDC reports salmonella outbreak linked to dry dog food,https://edition.cnn.com/2023/11/09/health/salmonella-dry-dog-food/index.html,"       US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention warned Thursday of a salmonella outbreak in humans that’s linked to dry dog food.           The agency issued a food safety alert, recording seven cases of salmonella across seven states that have resulted in one hospitalization. Most of those infected were infants.           The US Food and Drug Administration announced a recall of the Victor brand Hi-Pro Plus dry dog food linked to the outbreak. Several other brands of dry dog and cat food sold by Hi-Pro Plus’s manufacturer, Mid America Pet Food, are also under FDA recall.           According to the CDC, disease from salmonella bacteria infects 1.35 million people in US each year, mostly through ingesting contaminated food or water. Common symptoms include diarrhea, fever and stomach cramps.           Though symptoms tend to go away on their own, some cases require hospitalization — which occurs over 26,000 times each year nationwide.           Infants are more likely to develop a severe salmonella infection because their immune systems are still developing, the agency said.     Sign up here to get The Results Are In with Dr. Sanjay Gupta every Tuesday from the CNN Health team.           According to Thursday’s alert, people in the recent outbreak were infected by touching contaminated dog food, touching dog bowls that contained the dog food or touching the poop or saliva of dogs that were fed the dog food. The outbreak strain was found in the pet foods during routine testing, the CDC announced.           The CDC recommends that pet owners throw away the recalled pet food in a sealed trash bag to avoid wildlife encountering the bacteria. Pet owners should also clean surfaces like pet bowls that may have touched the pet food.           Individuals should contact a health care provider if they begin noticing symptoms like diarrhea and vomiting, the CDC said.    © 2023 Cable News Network. A Warner Bros. Discovery Company.

health,FDA approves first vaccine against chikungunya virus,https://edition.cnn.com/2023/11/09/health/chikungunya-virus-vaccine/index.html,"       The US Food and Drug Administration said Thursday that it has approved the first vaccine to prevent disease caused by the chikungunya virus.           The single-dose vaccine, Ixchiq, made by Valneva Austria GmbH, is approved for adults who are at an increased risk of exposure to the virus. Ixchiq was granted fast track and breakthrough therapy designations.     Mosquitoes are driving these birds to extinction. With only 5 left in the wild, scientists are racing to save the species         Chikungunya, a mosquito-borne disease whose name in the Makonde dialect of Africa means “bending over in pain,” has no specific treatment and can be debilitating and even deadly for newborns. Health experts consider it to be an emerging threat to global health made worse by climate change, with at least 5 million cases in the past 15 years, although deaths and severe illness are rare, according to the World Health Organization.           People most at risk of infection live in Africa, Southeast Asia and parts of the Americas, where chikungunya-carrying mosquitoes are endemic, but the climate crisis has driven the virus to new parts of the world.           Before 2006, the virus was rarely identified even in US travelers, the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention says, but studies identified a couple dozen cases in the US travelers between 2006 and 2013. In late 2014, cases that stemmed from local transmission were reported in warmer parts of the US: Florida, Texas, Puerto Rico and the US Virgin Islands.           People who get sick with chikungunya typically have a fever and can develop joint pain. They may also have a headache, muscle pain and a rash. For some, the joint pain can be debilitating, and it can last years. About 20% to 30% of cases are expected to become chronic, research shows. For newborns, chikungunya can be a potentially deadly threat.           Ixchiq contains a live, weakened version of the virus, so it may cause symptoms that are similar to an infection.     A tropical parasite, passed through the bite of a sand fly, is causing skin infections in the US         The FDA said that in one study, the vaccine virus was detected in people’s blood in the first few weeks after they were vaccinated. The prescribing information that comes with the vaccine carries a warning to make sure health care providers tell their patients that it is not known whether the vaccine virus can be transmitted from a pregnant person to their newborn, and it is not clear whether the vaccine virus can hurt a newborn. The warning tells providers to weigh the threat of the virus to the patient, as well as the gestational age and risks to the fetus or neonate from the disease.           Because there’s no specific treatment for chikungunya, doctors typically tell patients to rest, drink lots of fluids and take over-the-counter medication to manage their fever or pain. But scientists say that a vaccine is the best option for people vulnerable to the virus.           “Infection with chikungunya virus can lead to severe disease and prolonged health problems, particularly for older adults and individuals with underlying medical conditions,” said Dr. Peter Marks, director of the FDA’s Center for Biologics Evaluation and Research, in a statement from the agency. “Today’s approval addresses an unmet medical need and is an important advancement in the prevention of a potentially debilitating disease with limited treatment options.”     Sign up here to get The Results Are In with Dr. Sanjay Gupta every Tuesday from the CNN Health team.           The FDA is requiring that vaccine maker Valneva do a postmarket study to make sure there are no serious risks to the vaccine.           The most common side effects reported in studies submitted to the FDA for the vaccine’s approval included headache, muscle and joint pain, fever, tenderness at the injection site and being tired. Nearly 2% of people who got the vaccine had severe chikungunya-like adverse reactions that required medical intervention. Only two of the nearly 3,500 people in the trials had to go to a hospital because of the reaction. Some also had a chikungunya-like adverse reaction that lasted at least 30 days. The vaccine comes with a warning to encourage providers to discuss any potential reactions a patient may have to the vaccine.    © 2023 Cable News Network. A Warner Bros. Discovery Company.

health,Exemptions for required vaccines for US kindergartners reach record high,https://edition.cnn.com/2023/11/09/health/kindergarten-vaccine-exemptions/index.html,"       The percentage of kindergartners who received their state-required vaccines for measles remained below the federal target last school year, and the rate of vaccine exemptions for children reached the highest level ever reported in the United States, according to new data published Thursday by the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.           Coverage for four key vaccines — the measles, mumps, and rubella (MMR) vaccine; diphtheria, tetanus, and acellular pertussis (DTaP) vaccine; poliovirus vaccine; and varicella vaccine for chickenpox — declined in a majority of states for the 2022-23 school year, the report said. Lower levels of vaccine coverage raise the risk of outbreaks, leaving the country vulnerable to diseases that can cause severe illness and death.     Dr. Tom Frieden: Covid-19 is still around, and so are these misconceptions         “Because clusters of under-vaccinated children can lead to outbreaks, it is important for immunization programs, schools, and providers to make sure children are fully vaccinated before school entry, or before provisional enrollment periods expire,” the CDC researchers wrote.           Many of these diseases have been eliminated from the United States for many years, making the trend “disturbing,” said Dr. William Schaffner, a professor in the Division of Infectious Diseases at Vanderbilt University Medical Center in Nashville and former medical director of the nonprofit National Foundation for Infectious Diseases. Schaffner was not involved in the report.           “To lower our guard – the protection of our population – would be tragic,” he said.           Vaccine coverage rates fell below 95% from the 2019-20 to 2021-22 school years, declining to about 93%. Last school year, coverage remained at about 93% for reported vaccinations, including 93.1% coverage for MMR and poliovirus, and 92.7% for DTaP, the report said.           The percentage of kindergartners — children around 5 and 6 years old — who are exempt from state-required vaccinations increased to 3% for the 2022–23 school year from 2.6% in 2021–22. Exemptions increased in 40 states and Washington, DC, according to the CDC.           Ten states reported exemptions for at least one vaccine that exceeded 5% of kindergartners. Exemptions beyond 5% limit the level of vaccination coverage possible, the researchers wrote, which raises the risk of an outbreak of vaccine-preventable diseases.     Childhood immunization rates that fell during Covid are improving but still not at pre-pandemic levels, data shows         National MMR coverage of about 93% during the 2022–23 school year translates to approximately 250,000 kindergartners who are at risk for measles infection, the new report said. About 4% of kindergartners nationwide were not fully vaccinated with MMR or formally exempt from getting it, but were allowed to attend school during a grace period for provisional enrollment.           Schaffner highlights that there are several thousand school districts across the country, all with their own unique vaccine-related documentation.           “We have some school districts where the attention to vaccination requirements is not as rigorous as others, and so some children slip through the cracks and could be admitted to kindergarten without having completed that state’s vaccination requirements,” he said.           There are some limitations to the data, including limited state comparisons due to the variation in state vaccination requirements, including the type of vaccine and the number of doses, and data collection methods. The CDC does not require school vaccinations.           All states have laws requiring specific vaccines for students and all school immunization laws grant exemptions to children for specific medical reasons. But 44 states and Washington, DC, also grant religious exemptions, and 15 states allow philosophical or moral exemptions for children, according to the National Conference of State Legislatures. In the new study, non-medical exemptions accounted for more than 90% of reported exemptions and approximately 100% of the increase in the national exemption rate.           The researchers also noted that the 2022-23 kindergarten class reached age-eligibility to complete most state-required vaccinations during the Covid-19 pandemic, when many vaccinations were interrupted or delayed.           Vaccine hesitancy also plays a role, according to Schaffner, who adds that because the current generation of parents and grandparents didn’t experience many of the diseases the vaccines protect against, “they underestimate how potentially serious they are.”     Sign up here to get The Results Are In with Dr. Sanjay Gupta every Tuesday from the CNN Health team.           Currently, school requirements do not include the Covid-19 vaccine, which is explicitly banned from being included in school mandates in at least 20 states. However, that vaccine did become part of the CDC’s recommended immunization schedule for both children and adults this year.           Aside from school requirements, the CDC recommends routine vaccination against 14 diseases for children before they turn 2 years old.           “The whole medical community will have to keep educating and convincing and reassuring parents that vaccinations are absolutely critical going forward,” Schaffner said. “Vaccine hesitancy and skepticism are out there and they’re not going away.”     CNN’s Deidre McPhillips contributed to this report.  © 2023 Cable News Network.

health,Long Covid is hard — here are five tips to help,https://edition.cnn.com/2023/11/09/health/long-covid-coping-tips-wellness/index.html," Editor’s note: Season 8 of the podcast Chasing Life with Dr. Sanjay Gupta gets back to basics with an in-depth examination of the brain in different states. Each episode will focus on one of those states — the distracted brain, the frightened brain, the nourished brain, etc. — to spotlight what is going on in our heads and how it impacts our bodies.   (CNN) — Brain fog, fatigue, heart palpitations, post-exertional malaise and dizziness are a handful of the symptoms associated people with long Covid in adults.           They are among the 12 symptoms identified as part of the National Institute of Health’s RECOVER initiative that can be reliably used to classify someone as having long Covid.           The rest are gastrointestinal distress, chronic cough, thirst, chest pain, abnormal movement, changes in sexual desire or capacity,  and a change or loss of smell and taste.           If you have experienced a certain number of these symptoms (they are weighted according to how specific to long Covid they are) then you may be one of the up to 23 million people in the United States who had or still has this condition.           Since the early days of the pandemic, it quickly became clear that some people who caught SARS-CoV-2 – the coronavirus that causes Covid-19 – did not fully recover. They continued to experience often debilitating symptoms for weeks, months and in some cases, years after their initial infection.           Doctors, researchers and health authorities were skeptical at first — and then stumped. They struggled to define and measure long Covid, to identify a cause for or a mechanism behind it. And to figure out which factors put people at higher risk of developing it.           While we have come a long way since the early days of the pandemic, many questions still remain, including how to prevent it in the first place (HINT: getting vaccinated against Covid seems to lower your risk even if you do get infected) and how to best treat symptoms once they emerge.     Almost 7% of adults and 1% of kids have struggled with long Covid, survey finds         Long Covid is not somebody else’s problem: a 2022 National Center for Health Statistics survey estimated that almost 7% of US adults, and more than 1% of children, who reported having Covid have struggled with long Covid at some point.           While the number of cases of long Covid have fallen since 2022 and many people recover to different degrees, people continue to get diagnosed with the illness and struggle with symptoms.           One of the most vexing symptoms that many patients report is brain fog, according to David Putrino, a neuroscientist and the director of Rehabilitation Innovation at the Mount Sinai Health System, in New York City.           “We’re starting to learn a lot more about what is happening in the brain during an acute Covid infection,” Putrino told CNN Chief Medical Correspondent Dr. Sanjay Gupta recently on his podcast Chasing Life.           Putrino said that researchers in the UK found “alarming changes” in brain size and cognitive function after a Covid infection, even in people who didn’t report experiencing long Covid. The study was published in the journal Nature in 2022. “Their brains had been changed,” said Putrino.           Another common complaint, said Putrino, is post-exertional malaise, which is the worsening of symptoms following even minor physical or mental exertion.     Scientists edge closer to finding a biomarker for long Covid, which could lead to better tests and treatments         “They didn’t say ‘post-exertional malaise.’ No one knew what post exertional malaise was, but they would say things like, ‘I went to get my groceries and then I crashed,’” Putrino said.         “‘Crash’ was a big word that was being used. ‘I went downstairs. My groceries were delivered. Carrying them up the stairs back to my apartment caused me to crash, and I couldn’t get out of bed for two days.’”           Putrino said that the wide-ranging symptoms of long Covid may be caused by one or more underlying factors, including micro-clots which block small blood vessels and lead to problems such as cognitive issues; persistent viral particles that continue to circulate and stir up our immune system; and the inflammation of the vagus nerve which can result in dysautonomia and manifest as POTS, or postural orthostatic tachycardia syndrome.           To hear more of Putrino’s conversation on the possible causes of long Covid and the search for biomarkers, listen to the full podcast episode here:           What can you do to help yourself if you have long Covid?  Putrino has these five tips:           Be aware of what your limits are and don’t push yourself beyond them to avoid crashing.           “One of the most important tools we have to prevent worsening or progression of long Covid is an energy conservation technique known as ‘pacing,’” Putrino said in an email.           The tricky thing is, your limits may change from day to day, and may be affected by many factors such as hormones, stress and even the weather.           Read more about pacing here.           Dysautonomia, a nervous system disorder, is a common cause of some of long Covid’s seemingly weird and disruptive symptoms, such as rapid heartbeat and dizziness.     Are some kids genetically predisposed to poor sleep? Study offers clues         “Your autonomic nervous system is a network of nerves in your body responsible for managing things like breathing, blood pressure, body temperature and healthy blood flow and organ function,” Putrino said.           “When the autonomic nervous system is knocked out of balance, it leads to a condition called dysautonomia. On average, 70% of people with long Covid experience dysautonomia and it contributes significantly to overall symptom burden. Dysautonomia is treatable with medications and rehabilitation.”           Learn more about dysautonomia here.         Sometimes, during both an acute Covid infection and in long Covid, a person experiences hyperinflammation across many body systems; researchers believe that this happens because mast cells are activated.           Mast cells  are allergy cells, which are part of the immune system; when they’re stimulated, they create inflammation and release many chemicals that can affect the skin, gastrointestinal tract, heart, respiratory, and neurologic systems.           “A large proportion of people with long Covid have developed Mast Cell Activation Syndrome (MCAS),” Putrino said. “MCAS can be extremely debilitating, but can also be well-managed with appropriate medical supervision using over-the-counter medications and supplements.”           Learn more about MCAS here.           Use breathwork for managing symptoms, said Putrino.           “Dysfunctional breathing and altered gas exchange is present in a majority of people with long Covid, and a daily breathwork practice can significantly improve daily symptoms.           Learn more about breathwork and long Covid here.     The loneliness epidemic: Nearly 1 in 4 adults feel lonely, new survey finds         This last tip is for caregivers and friends of people with long Covid, or anyone with a chronic disease.  “Being newly diagnosed with a chronic illness is an incredibly isolating experience, and social isolation can have serious health effects,” Putrino explained.           “Your loved one with long Covid may no longer be able to socially connect with you in the same way that they used to, but that doesn’t mean they don’t want to spend time with you,” he said.  “Make an effort to connect with a loved one with long Covid.”           Learn more about the effects of social isolation on health here.     We hope these five tips help you cope with some of long Covid’s symptoms. Listen to the full episode here.

health,Reducing pesticides in food: Major food manufacturers earn an F grade,https://edition.cnn.com/2023/11/08/health/pesticides-food-report-wellness/index.html,"       Seventeen major food manufacturers earned an average grade of F for their lack of progress in reducing pesticides in the products they sell, according to a new analysis by As You Sow, a nonprofit specializing in shareholder advocacy.     Common contaminants linked to accelerated weight gain in children         “Many companies set pesticide reduction goals of 2025 and 2030 that appeal to shareholders,” said Cailin Dendas, lead author for the report, “Pesticides in the Pantry: Transparency & Risk in Food Supply Chains,” published Wednesday.           “Now, we’re looking at the progress companies are making to achieve those goals, and finding little significant movement,” said Dendas, environmental health program coordinator for the nonprofit.           “It’s disheartening to see so many bad grades across the board for these major food production companies,” said Jane Houlihan, research director for Healthy Babies, Bright Futures, an alliance of nonprofits, scientists and donors with a mission of reducing babies’ exposures to neurotoxic chemicals.           “Studies find the highest amounts of pesticides in some of the most popular foods children eat — berries and apples, for example,” said Houlihan, who was not involved in the report. “Pesticides are also found in breast milk and umbilical cord blood, meaning that exposures start before birth and continue through infancy and beyond.”           Long-term exposure to pesticides has been linked to cancer, asthma, anxiety, Parkinson’s disease, depression, and attention deficit and hyperactivity disorder, according to the report.           “Pesticides may enter the body through the skin, eyes, lungs, and/or mouth, causing acute or chronic health problems, and can be carried home on clothing,” the report stated.           Children are especially susceptible to contaminants such as pesticides, even while in the womb.     Blueberries have joined green beans in this year’s Dirty Dozen list         “Pesticide exposure during pregnancy may lead to an increased risk of birth defects, low birth weight, and fetal death,” the American Academy of Pediatrics stated. “Exposure in childhood has been linked to attention and learning problems, as well as cancer.”           Yet pesticide exposure is widespread, even for chemicals that were banned years ago by federal agencies. In the 2023 Shopper’s Guide to Pesticides in Produce — a list of nonorganic produce with the most pesticides — researchers found 210 different pesticides on the 12 foods.           Kale, collard and mustard greens contained the largest number of pesticides — 103 types — while nearly 90% of blueberry and green bean samples had concerning findings, according to the analysis released in March by the Environmental Working Group, a research and advocacy nonprofit that focuses on consumer health, toxic chemicals and pollutants.           Green bean samples contained extremely high levels of acephate, an insecticide banned for use in the vegetable in 2011 by the US Environmental Protection Agency.           “One sample of non-organic green beans had acephate at a level 500 times greater than the limit set by the Environmental Protection Agency,” Alexis Temkin, toxicologist at the EWG with expertise in toxic chemicals and pesticides, told CNN in a prior interview.           Blueberry samples contained acephate, phosmet and malathion — organophosphates which interfere with the normal function of the nervous system, according to the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.           More than 1 billion pounds of pesticides are used each year in the United States alone, while farmers worldwide spend nearly $60 billion annually on pesticides, according to the report.     FDA proposes ban on potentially harmful ingredient found in some sodas         Pesticide use is expected to rise as the climate crisis worsens and the planet continues to warm. Rising soil temperatures spur the degradation of pesticides, decreasing their effectiveness and requiring greater amounts of chemicals to be used to maintain crop yields, the report said.           “Superstorms from climate change are flooding fields, washing away the nutrient dense topsoil farmers are relying on to maintain consistent crop yields each year,” Dendas said. “More rainfall in some regions is also carrying toxic pesticides into waterways, polluting our drinking water and generating dead zones in our oceans.”           Hotter weather also increases pests’ metabolisms, “leading them to increase their consumption of crops,” Dendas said. At the same time, heat reduces pest resilience in crops, again spurring additional use of pesticides.           Compounding the problem, the use of pesticides, particularly neonicotinoids, are “one of the top three causes of pollinator population decline globally,” the report said. Dubbed “neonics,” this class of pesticide is killing bees, butterflies and birds as well as invasive species.           The As You Sow report rated each company on 27 key elements of risk reduction, such as public transparency on pesticide use, identifying and reducing high-risk pesticides, and requiring suppliers of raw foods such as tomatoes, potatoes, wheat and corn to do pesticide risk assessments.     Organic? Free range? What do food labels actually mean?         Scores are based on publicly available information, such as published reports, press statements and website text, as well as conversations and additional materials provided by the companies, Dendas said.           Prior analyses by As You Sow found small improvements in pesticide policies in 2019 and 2021, but manufacturer scores dropped dramatically in 2023 when the nonprofit made key performance indicators more actionable, she said. The average grade in 2021 was a D, which dropped to an F in 2023.           General Mills, which earned a B in 2021, was in this year’s top spot with a C rating. Archer Daniels Midland Co., also known as ADM, and PepsiCo Inc. received a C minus; Conagra Brands Inc. and Campbell Soup Company received a D score, while Lamb Weston Holdings Inc. and Nestlé received a D minus.           The rest of the companies received an F: B&G Foods Inc., Cargill, Danone S.A., Del Monte Pacific Ltd., General Mills Inc., Kellanova, The Kraft Heinz Company, Mars Incorporated, Mondelēz International Inc., Post Holdings Inc., and The J. M. Smucker Co.           The low scores remained in spite of advances by some of the companies in areas such as developing strategy to combat pesticides, using third-party auditors to measure pesticide use by suppliers and improving data transparency.           “None of the companies has supplier standards that reduce the use of neonicotinoids or utilize drift-reduction agents if using dicamba,” a type of pesticide, the report said. Exposure to dicamba can cause headaches, nausea, vomiting and dizziness.           Nor are any of the companies prioritizing the health and safety of farmworkers, who are using the chemicals in the fields and have the highest rates of exposure, the report said.           “Low wages and no benefits leave many farmworkers defenseless against the toxic health effects of pesticides in their workplaces,” the report said.     Potentially harmful chemicals used in many cosmetic products banned by California governor         Why did As You Sow turn up the heat on these companies?           “Our agricultural supply chain is broken and we no longer have the time to sit around and wait for companies to act,” Dendas said. “We need these companies to adopt regenerative agriculture programs and policies to ensure long-term food production.”           Regenerative agriculture uses traditional farming practices developed by Native Americans, such as avoiding or reducing soil tillage, using livestock, diversifying crops, and planting cover crops to avoid erosion.           “Science shows time and time again that farmers using regenerative agriculture practices are increasing retention of soil, preventing crop loss from storms, they’re increasing the nutrient density of soil, and ultimately, creating more nutritious food,” Dendas said.           CNN reached out to each of the companies for comment. “We respectfully don’t have any comment to offer on this,” said Dane Lisser, media relations at ADM, short for Archer Daniels Midland Co., which received a C minus.     Foods that improve brain function and mood         Nestlé, which scored a D minus on the report, told CNN the company worked closely with “our suppliers on their measures to control pesticide use and any residues.           “Our people across our business are working hard every day to help transition to regenerative agriculture practices in our supply chain, and this includes preventative pest programs and reducing pesticide use. Globally, we are investing over $1 billion in these efforts across our supply chain,” a Nestlé spokesperson said via email.           Shelby Stoolman, a spokesperson for Lamb Weston Holdings Inc., which made a D minus, provided this response via email: “The report and scorecard continue to be a good resource for benchmarking our programs and transparency with others in the food industry. The shift of questions to focus on additional transparency … and rigor around data measurement and disclosure promote ongoing dialog as we strive to improve.”           CNN did not receive any additional responses from companies before publication.           What can consumers do? Vote with your pocketbook, Dendas said, which will send a message to companies that are not moving quickly enough to solve the problem.           In addition, consumers can ask food companies to “release the actual test results of pesticide concentrations in their products,” said EWG’s Temkin.     FDA finalizes limit on how much arsenic can be in apple juice         “Food companies have not been publishing such data, instead relying on generalities,” she said via email. “Reviewing company policies is an essential first step. But it needs to be reinforced with independent testing of food products for various pesticides.”           Choosing organic foods is a surefire way to reduce pesticide exposure, Houlihan said.           “Organic can be more expensive, so fortunately there are nutritious foods that are very low in pesticides even when grown conventionally — watermelon, mangoes, pineapple and carrots, for example,” she said. “EWG’s Shopper’s Guide gives lists of foods with the highest and lowest amounts of pesticides to help parents lower their families’ exposures.”         While organic foods are not more nutritious, the majority have little to no pesticide residue, Temkin said.           “If a person switches to an organic diet, the levels of pesticides in their urine rapidly decrease,” Temkin told CNN previously. “We see it time and time again.”           If organic isn’t available or too pricey, “I would definitely recommend peeling and washing thoroughly with water,” Temkin said. “Steer away from detergents or other advertised items. Rinsing with water will reduce pesticide levels.”           Additional tips on washing produce, provided by the US Food and Drug Administration, include:    © 2023 Cable News Network. A Warner Bros.

health,Breast implants play a crucial role in innovative procedure to save life of man with severe lung damage,https://edition.cnn.com/2023/11/08/health/lung-transplant-breast-implants/index.html,"       When 34-year-old Davey Bauer’s lungs stopped working, doctors turned to an unusual ﻿tool to help keep him alive: large breast implants.           Experts say it was an innovative solution to give Bauer’s body time to fight off a nasty infection so it could accept a lifesaving double lung transplant. It may be the first instance of a potential transplant practice that could save people with infectious disease who probably would not have survived just years ago.     Who should worry about lung cancer? A doctor explains         Bauer’s case started in April, when he felt like he couldn’t catch his breath. The avid snow- and skateboarder had always been healthy. He kept in good shape and maintained a healthy weight working in landscaping in De Soto, Missouri. But he had long been a smoker, starting a pack-a-day cigarette habit when he was 21. He switched to vaping in 2014.           “I thought it was the healthier alternative,” Bauer said. ”But, in all honesty, I found it more addicting than cigarettes.”           When people smoke or vape, it can leave lung tissue inflamed, making the organ more susceptible to infection. Additionally, Bauer said, he hadn’t gotten a flu shot, and it was still flu season.           “All these risk factors aligned: compromised lung health with the cigarettes and the vaping, not being vaccinated against the influenza and then you have infection,” said Bauer’s doctor Dr. Ankit Bharat, chief of thoracic surgery and director of the Canning Thoracic Institute at Northwestern Medicine. “Everything aligns, and then you’re set up for a major disaster.”           When Bauer’s breathing troubles continued, he went to the doctor, and tests showed that he had the flu. His breathing problems got so bad that he had to be admitted to a St. Louis hospital. He also developed an additional lung infection that antibiotics weren’t clearing up.           The damage to his lungs became so extensive that doctors put him on extracorporeal membrane oxygenation or ECMO, a tool that pumped and oxygenated Bauer’s blood from outside his body. The device is designed to allow a patient’s lungs and heart a chance to rest so they can heal, but it wasn’t enough in this case.           Doctors determined that his only hope would be a double lung transplant. They transferred Bauer to Northwestern Memorial Hospital in Chicago, but his condition took another turn for the worse.           “The day after he arrived, he basically coded. His heart stopped. They’re doing CPR on him. That’s how sick he was,” Bharat said.     More adults should be screened for lung cancer under updated guideline, American Cancer Society says         It was a different kind of challenge from a typical lung transplant, he said. Often, people who need a transplant have a chronic condition like emphysema or cystic fibrosis that develops over time. Doctors can plan, and patients can work on being the healthiest they can be in their condition and can wait for a donor to become available. In that case, doctors take out a person’s damaged lungs when they have donor lungs and replace them right away. But this wasn’t the situation with Bauer.           He had acute lung failure. He didn’t have time to wait for a donor – and yet he was too sick to go through a transplant procedure.           “Someone who is actively dying and was so sick like David, generally, will have no option of transplant, and they generally just die,” Bharat said. “We had to come up with a strategy to do something that we’ve never done before.”           Bharat has a history of successful double lung transplants on people with severe infections and even late-stage cancer. In June 2020, he and Northwestern Medicine surgeons performed the first known double-lung transplant on a Covid-19 patient in the US, and the patient survived and was discharged from the hospital. They could use a similar approach here.           But the first challenge they had to overcome was the infection.           “When we opened the chest, it was full of pus, just yellow, nasty smelly things,” Bharat said. Surgeons removed the lungs carefully, so as not to spread any germs, and cleaned everything out, which seemed to contain the infection. They also kept Bauer on heavy antibiotics.           They thought it could take weeks, but within a couple of days, his body seemed to have cleared the infection.           “He miraculously started to look really good, and we thought we could do the transfer,” Bharat said.           Another problem was how to keep Bauer’s blood flowing while they waited for the infection to clear so his body could be ready for the donor lungs.     Higher rates of lung cancer in women are a mystery for researchers         The heart and lungs work together through the heart’s two pumps, which are attached to each other on the right and left side. The blood goes from the right to the left through the lungs.           Bharat described it like a highway going one direction, to the right side from the heart to the lungs, and another highway going back to the left side. In a body, the organs return the blood to the right side of the heart, which pumps it into the lungs. The lungs put oxygen in and take carbon dioxide out. Then this highway system turns it back to the left side of the heart, which pumps the blood to the rest of the body, which sends it back to the heart, and the cycle goes on.           Taking out the lungs destroys the highway system, and there’s no connection between the right and left. “That’s not a survivable situation,” Bharat said.           Doctors had to use parts of the ECMO machine to create artificial channels to move the blood around Bauer’s body.           “I spent the whole night thinking about how I’m going to create these channels and do all these things,” Bharat said.           The final challenge was what to do with the heart. It’s in the center of the body, and although it’s attached to multiple blood vessels, Bharat said, it’s “floppy.”           “When the patient turns, it can fall on one side and so forth and kink everything, so we had to create a mechanism to just keep the heart in the center,” Bharat said.           Lab sponges weren’t big enough, he said, and they needed something that could be molded inside his chest. That’s where the breast implants came in: Double-D implants inside his chest cavity managed to temporarily keep the heart where it was supposed to be.     Dozens of health organizations pledge ‘full support’ for federal ban on menthol cigarettes and flavored cigars         The entire process took only a few days. Doctors removed Bauer’s lungs May 26, and a donor pair became available the next day. On May 28, surgeons removed the placeholder breast implants and inserted the donor lungs.           The team at Northwestern told Bauer’s family that it was by far one of the most complex cases they had ever seen.           “He’s on track for full recovery, and it’s kind of really amazing for us to see,” Bharat said.           The procedure came with real risks, even bigger ones than one would see with a typical lung transplant, said Dr. Yoshiya Toyoda, surgical director of thoracic transplantation, chief of cardiovascular surgery and director of mechanical circulatory support at Temple University Hospital, who was not involved with Bauer’s case.           A typical lung transplant involves only one surgery, to remove the lung and put in the donated organ. All surgery comes with serious risk, and Bauer’s case involved multiple procedures. Using a human-made system to keep blood flowing also runs the risk of develop clots that could cause a stroke. “That’s another disadvantage with this approach,” Toyoda said. But, he added, “I want to congratulate them, because it was successful.”           By June, Bauer was already sitting up, and he was able to breathe on his own for a few hours at a time, according to the family’s Gofundme page. By mid-June, he was off his breathing machines and breathing with his new lungs.           It took several months in intensive care to recover, but by late September, he was healthy enough to be discharged and to continue with therapy in a rehab facility outside the hospital.

Dr. Albert Rizzo, chief medical officer with the American Lung Association, said that the success of his recovery is notable and that the technique doctors used was innovative.           “I talked to a few transplant surgeons yesterday, and they feel it was innovative as well,” he said. “It really sounds like an ingenious way of trying to solve a problem.”           Unfortunately, Bauer won’t likely be able to go to opening day at Busch Stadium next spring to see his beloved St. Louis Cardinals. He has to stick around Chicago for the next year so his doctors at Northwestern can monitor him closely.           His doctors said they have not been able to convert Bauer into a Chicago Cubs fan yet, but he has embraced the innovation of their efforts to save him.           He told the doctors at Northwestern that he’s changing all his gaming profiles and getting a t-shirt made with his new nickname: “DD Davey.”    © 2023 Cable News Network. A Warner Bros.

health,Cao et al./Courtesy Cell,https://edition.cnn.com/2023/11/09/world/chimeric-monkey-live-birth-stem-cell-scn/index.html," Sign up for CNN’s Wonder Theory science newsletter. Explore the universe with news on fascinating discoveries, scientific advancements and more.         Scientists based in China have created a monkey chimera with two sets of DNA, experimental work they say could ultimately benefit medical research and the conservation of endangered species.           The monkey, which lived for 10 days before being euthanized, was made by combining stem cells from a cynomolgus monkey — also known as a crab-eating or long-tailed macaque, a primate used in biomedical research — with a genetically distinct embryo from the same monkey species. It’s the world’s first live birth of a primate chimera created with stem cells, the researchers said.           A proof-of-concept study detailing the research, which published Thursday in the scientific journal Cell, said it was notable that the monkey was “substantially chimeric,” containing a varying but relatively high ratio of cells that grew out of the stem cells throughout its body.     Breakthroughs in race to create lab models of human embryos raise hopes and concerns         “It is encouraging that our live birth monkey chimera had a big contribution (of stem cells) to the brain, suggesting that indeed this approach should be valuable for modeling neurodegenerative diseases,” said study coauthor Miguel Esteban, principal investigator at the Guangzhou Institute of Biomedicine and Health, Chinese Academy of Sciences and a researcher with BGI-Research Hangzhou, a nonprofit arm of Chinese genetics firm BGI.           “Monkey chimeras also have potential enormous value for species conservation if they could be achieved between two types of nonhuman primate species, one of which is endangered,” he added. “If there is contribution of the donor cells from the endangered species to the germ line, one could envisage that through breeding animals of these species could be produced.”           The term chimera originated from the monstrous hybrid creatures that populate Greek myths, but chimeric mice were first created in the 1960s and have been commonly used in biomedical research.           Chimeric lab mice allow scientists to track how normal cells interact with genetically altered or mutated cells, which is useful for understanding biological processes and disease. But there are limitations with research on mice that make pursuing efforts with monkeys worthwhile, the scientists said.           “Mice don’t reproduce many aspects of human disease for their physiology being too different from ours. In contrast, human and monkey are close evolutionary, so human diseases can be more faithfully modeled in monkeys,” said senior study author Zhen Liu of the Chinese Academy of Sciences.     Second person to receive experimental pig heart transplant dies nearly six weeks after procedure         More controversial are human-animal chimeras, which contain some human cells, and some cells from other species. Scientists have created mouse embryos that are part human, and in 2021, scientists reported that they had grown human-monkey chimeric embryos.           Scientists hope that part-human chimeras may one day help to fill the demand for organ transplants. In September, researchers reported that they had grown kidneys containing mostly human cells inside pig embryos.           Liu said at a news briefing that it would be crossing an ethical red line to attempt to produce a monkey-human chimera beyond early embryonic stages of development.           The team cultured nine stem cell lines using cells removed from 7-day-old monkey embryos. The researchers made the cells pluripotent — giving them the ability to organize into all the different cell types needed to create a live animal.           Then they selected a subset of cells to inject into genetically distinct 4- to 5-day-old embryos from the same monkey species. The cells were also infused with a green fluorescent protein so the researchers would be able to determine which tissues had grown out of the stem cells.     Gene-edited pig kidney keeps monkey alive for 2 years, trial finds, a step toward longer-lasting human transplants         The embryos were implanted into female monkeys, resulting in 12 pregnancies and six live births. One of the monkeys that was born and one fetus that was miscarried were “substantially chimeric,” containing cells that grew out of the stem cells throughout their bodies, according to the study.           “This is an important study, but I wouldn’t consider it’s a breakthrough as the chimeras generated are not viable,” said Jun Wu, an associate professor in molecular biology at the University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center.           He added that the team also hadn’t been able to demonstrate that the stem cells used to generate the chimeras were inheritable by offspring — something that would be necessary to generate monkey disease models for medical research. Wu wasn’t involved in the study but has worked on human-animal chimeras.           The percentage of stem cells in the monkey’s tissue ranged from 21% to 92%, with an average of 67% across the 26 different types of tissue that were tested, according to the study. The percentage was notably high in brain tissue.            “It is a very good and important paper,” said Jacob Hanna, a professor of stem cell biology and embryology at the Weizmann Institute of Science in Israel who was not involved with the study.           “This study may contribute to easier and better making of mutant monkeys, just like biologists have been doing for years with mice,” Hanna added. “Of course, work with (nonhuman primates) is slower and much harder but is important.”           The use of monkeys in scientific research is a contentious issue because of ethical concerns about animal welfare. The team said it followed Chinese laws and international guidelines governing the use of nonhuman primates in scientific research.     Scientists create mice from two dads after making eggs from skin cells         Penny Hawkins, head of animals in science at the Royal Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals, said that she was “deeply concerned about the inherent animal suffering and wastage associated with the application of these technologies to sentient animals.”           She noted that 40 female macaque monkeys had embryos implanted, of which only 12 led to pregnancies. Six of these resulted in live births, but only one had the desired genetic makeup. A vet euthanized it after 10 days due to respiratory failure and hypothermia.           In the United States, research on nonhuman primates made up 0.5% of all animals used in scientific research, according to a report by the panel of the National Academies of Sciences, Engineering and Medicine released in May.           The panel found that research involving monkeys, because of their similarities to people, had been critical to lifesaving medical advances, including the creation of vaccines against Covid-19. The report also concluded that a shortage of nonhuman primates had negatively affected research necessary for both public health and national security.    © 2023 Cable News Network. A Warner Bros.

health,HUM Images/Universal Images Group Editorial/Getty Images,https://edition.cnn.com/2023/11/09/us/frank-borman-apollo-astronaut-obit-scn/index.html," Sign up for CNN’s Wonder Theory science newsletter. Explore the universe with news on fascinating discoveries, scientific advancements and more.   Apollo astronaut Col. Frank Borman, who commanded the first mission to orbit the moon, has died in Billings, Montana, NASA announced. He was 95.           “Today we remember one of NASA’s best. Astronaut Frank Borman was a true American hero. Among his many accomplishments, he served as the commander of the Apollo 8 mission, humanity’s first mission around the Moon in 1968,” said NASA Administrator Bill Nelson Thursday in a statement.           “In addition to his critical role as commander of the Apollo 8 mission, he is a veteran of Gemini 7, spending 14 days in low-Earth orbit and conducting the first rendezvous in space, coming within a few feet of the Gemini 6 spacecraft,” Nelson said.           Borman died November 7, according to the statement.

Apollo astronaut Col. Frank Borman, who commanded the first mission to orbit the moon, has died in Billings, Montana, NASA announced. He was 95.           “Today we remember one of NASA’s best. Astronaut Frank Borman was a true American hero. Among his many accomplishments, he served as the commander of the Apollo 8 mission, humanity’s first mission around the Moon in 1968,” said NASA Administrator Bill Nelson Thursday in a statement.           “In addition to his critical role as commander of the Apollo 8 mission, he is a veteran of Gemini 7, spending 14 days in low-Earth orbit and conducting the first rendezvous in space, coming within a few feet of the Gemini 6 spacecraft,” Nelson said.           Borman died November 7, according to the statement.

Dinkinesh, a small asteroid that NASA’s Lucy mission visited last week, continues to surprise.           Lucy swung by the space rock, located in the main asteroid belt between Mars and Jupiter, on November 1 as part of a test of the spacecraft’s equipment before tackling the mission’s primary goal: surveying the swarms of Trojan asteroids around Jupiter. The flyby of Dinkinesh, which means “marvelous” in the Amharic language of Ethiopia, wasn’t even added to Lucy’s itinerary until January.           But the first views captured by Lucy’s instruments showed there was more to the shadowy asteroid than expected. At first, images suggested that the space rock was part of a binary pair, with a smaller asteroid orbiting Dinkinesh.           However, additional images taken by the spacecraft just after the flyby’s closest approach have now revealed that the smaller asteroid is actually a contact binary — two smaller space rocks that touch each other.           Lucy came within 265 miles (about 425 kilometers) of the asteroid’s surface during its closest approach, which is when the first images were taken. The second batch of images revealing the contact binary, shared by NASA on Tuesday, were taken six minutes later from 1,010 miles (about 1,630 kilometers) away.           “Contact binaries seem to be fairly common in the solar system,” said John Spencer, Lucy deputy project scientist at the Southwest Research Institute, in a statement.           “We haven’t seen many up-close, and we’ve never seen one orbiting another asteroid.We’d been puzzling over odd variations in Dinkinesh’s brightness that we saw on approach, which gave us a hint that Dinkinesh might have a moon of some sort, but we never suspected anything so bizarre!”           The close approach was primarily designed to help the Lucy spacecraft test its terminal tracking system, which allows the spacecraft to locate the space rock autonomously and keep it within view while flying by at 10,000 miles per hour (4.5 kilometers per second). The system surpassed expectations, which allowed astronomers to make the discovery of Dinkinesh’s unexpected companion.           “It is puzzling, to say the least,” said Hal Levison, principal investigator for Lucy at the Southwest Research Institute, in a statement. “I would have never expected a system that looks like this. In particular, I don’t understand why the two components of the satellite have similar sizes. This is going to be fun for the scientific community to figure out.”           Data from the flyby is still transmitting from the spacecraft to the mission team.           “It’s truly marvelous when nature surprises us with a new puzzle,” said Tom Statler, Lucy program scientist at NASA, in a statement. “Great science pushes us to ask questions that we never knew we needed to ask.”           Lucy’s next close encounter will be with another main belt asteroid called Donaldjohanson in 2025. And then, the spacecraft will set off to see the Trojans.     Euclid telescope’s first images reveal new cosmic details         The Trojan asteroids, which borrow their name from Greek mythology, orbit the sun in two swarms — one that’s ahead of Jupiter, the largest planet in our solar system, and a second one that lags behind it. Too distant to be seen in detail with telescopes, the asteroids will get their close-up when Lucy reaches the Trojans in 2027.           The mission borrows its name from the Lucy fossil, the remains of an ancient human ancestor discovered in Ethiopia in 1974. The skeleton has helped researchers piece together aspects of human evolution, and NASA Lucy team members hope their mission will achieve a similar feat regarding the history of our solar system.

Two powerful NASA telescopes have detected the oldest and most distant black hole ever found.           Data captured via energetic X-rays by the Chandra X-ray Observatory and James Webb Space Telescope has helped astronomers spot the signature of a growing black hole within the early universe just 470 million years after the big bang, which occurred 13.8 billion years ago.           The discovery, described in a study published Monday in the journal Nature Astronomy, may help astronomers piece together how some of the first supermassive black holes formed in the cosmos.           “We needed Webb to find this remarkably distant galaxy and Chandra to find its supermassive black hole,” said lead study author Akos Bogdan, in a statement. “We also took advantage of a cosmic magnifying glass that boosted the amount of light we detected.” Bogdan is an astrophysicist at the Harvard-Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics in Cambridge, Massachusetts.     Euclid telescope’s first images reveal new cosmic details         He was referring to an effect called gravitational lensing, which occurs when closer objects — in this case a galactic cluster — act like a magnifying glass for distant objects. Gravity essentially warps and amplifies the light of distant galaxies in the background of whatever is doing the magnifying, enabling observations of otherwise invisible celestial features.           Astronomers detected the black hole in a galaxy called UHZ1. At first glance, the galaxy appeared in the same direction as a cluster of galaxies known as Abell 2744, which is located about 3.5 billion light-years from Earth. But data collected by the Webb telescope showed that UHZ1 is actually much farther away and located beyond the cluster at 13.2 billion light-years from Earth.           A light-year, equivalent to 5.88 trillion miles, is how far a beam of light travels in a year. Given the distance between Earth and the objects from the early days of the universe, when telescopes like Webb observe this light, it’s effectively like looking into the past.           The team used the Chandra Observatory to detect superheated gas releasing X-rays within UHZ1, the telltale sign of a supermassive black hole growing in size.           The detection was made possible by the Abell cluster of galaxies, which intensified the light of the UHZ1 galaxy and the X-rays released by the black hole by a factor of four.           Astronomers think the discovery will help them to better understand how supermassive black holes appeared and reached their monstrous masses so soon after the beginning of the universe.           The researchers want to know whether the giant celestial objects formed when massive clouds of gas collapsed or if they resulted from the explosions of the very first massive stars.           “There are physical limits on how quickly black holes can grow once they’ve formed, but ones that are born more massive have a head start. It’s like planting a sapling, which takes less time to grow into a full-size tree than if you started with only a seed,” said Andy Goulding, research scholar in astrophysical sciences at Princeton University in New Jersey.     Webb telescope image captures ghostly glow of the Crab Nebula         He is a coauthor on the Nature Astronomy paper and lead author of another paper on the UHZ1 galaxy published in September in The Astrophysical Journal Letters.           The team reporting its results in the Nature Astronomy paper had discovered that the distant black hole’s mass is similar to the entire mass of all of the stars within the galaxy that hosts it. The mass falls somewhere between that of 10 million and 100 million suns, judging by the brightness and energy of the X-rays emitted by it, the researchers said.           Typically, black holes located at the centers of galaxies only have about 0.1% the mass of the stars within their host galaxy.           The unusual black hole could be an “Outsize Black Hole” that formed when a huge cloud of gas collapsed, as theorized in 2017 by Priyamvada Natarajan, a coauthor on both studies and the Joseph S. and Sophia S. Fruton professor of astronomy and professor of physics at Yale University in New Haven, Connecticut.           “We think that this is the first detection of an ‘Outsize Black Hole’ and the best evidence yet obtained that some black holes form from massive clouds of gas,” Natarajan said. “For the first time we are seeing a brief stage where a supermassive black hole weighs about as much as the stars in its galaxy, before it falls behind.”    © 2023 Cable News Network.

After a long day, you flop onto the sofa and find yourself dozing off while watching TV. The room is nice and warm, the sofa is comfortable, and the background noise of the TV lulls you to sleep.           Then a loved one nudges you awake and reminds you to go sleep — in bed. But when you get there, you find to your frustration that you’re wide awake.           Why does sleep come so easily on the sofa but not always in bed?     Sleep pressure is one reason why you fall asleep on the sofa. This refers to the strength of the biological drive for sleep. The longer you have been awake, the greater the sleep pressure.     Sleep this way to add almost 5 years to your life         Your body clock or circadian rhythm is another factor. This tells you to be awake during the day and to sleep at night.           Your environment will also affect how likely it is you fall asleep. You might have just eaten a meal; your comfortable sofa is in a warm room, with dim lighting and maybe a TV program in the background. For many people, this environment is perfect for falling asleep.

READ MORE: How do I stop my mind racing and get some sleep?         If you have had a nap on the sofa before heading to bed, your sleep pressure is likely much lower than it was before your nap. Instead of having more than 16 hours of wakefulness behind you, you have just woken up and therefore have less sleep pressure. This can make it much harder to fall asleep in bed.     Short sleep negates benefits of exercise for the brain, study says         If you just fell asleep on the sofa for five minutes, you might not have too much trouble getting to sleep in bed. A nap that short is unlikely to reduce your sleep pressure very much. But if you were asleep for an hour, it might be a different story.           Your sleep cycles might also be working against you. Most sleep cycles are about 90 minutes long. They start with light sleep, progress to deep sleep and then end with light sleep again. If you wake up during deep sleep, you’re probably going to feel groggy — and it might be easy to get back to sleep when you go to bed. But if you wake up during light sleep, it could be harder to fall asleep again in bed.           The activities you might do when you get up from the sofa — such as turning on bright lights or brushing your teeth — can also make you feel more alert and make it harder to sleep when you get to bed.     READ MORE: How can I get some sleep? Which treatments actually work?         There are other reasons why falling asleep in your bed could be challenging. Many people experience anxiety about falling asleep. They worry about getting enough sleep or falling asleep fast enough.           In such cases, getting into bed can be associated with feelings of stress and apprehension, which make it even harder to sleep. It might be easier to fall asleep on the couch, where there is less stress involved.           It might also be harder to fall asleep in bed because of poor sleep hygiene. This refers to your presleep behaviors and sleep environment.           Good sleep hygiene, or healthy sleep habits, includes having a regular routine before bed, a dark, quiet room to sleep in, and not using your mobile phone in bed. For many people who don’t have good sleep hygiene, their behaviors before bed and their bedroom environment might not be conducive to sleep.     READ MORE: What happens if you need to pee while you’re asleep?         First, make sure your room is dark, quiet and comfortable.

In summer, you might consider air-conditioning or a fan to make your bedroom comfortable for sleeping.     Getting less slow-wave sleep as you age may increase your risk of dementia, study finds         If you find it easy to fall asleep with the TV on, you might like to play “white noise” in your bedroom as you fall asleep.

Making sure you follow the same bedtime routine every night (including going to bed at the same time) can help.           Also, even though it’s hard, try not to look at your phone while you’re in bed.

Making sure you follow the same bedtime routine every night (including going to bed at the same time) can help.           Also, even though it’s hard, try not to look at your phone while you’re in bed. Scrolling on your phone before bed can make it harder to sleep due to both exposure to blue light and the potentially stressful or alerting effect of the content with which you interact.     READ MORE: Hitting snooze on your alarm might not actually make you more tired in the morning         The best way to make it easier to fall asleep in your bed is to avoid falling asleep on the sofa in the first place.           This will ensure all the sleep pressure you build up during the day will be directed toward a deep sleep in your bed.

health,What it’s like to work with ADHD,https://edition.cnn.com/2023/11/01/health/working-with-adhd-personal-essay-wellness-cec/index.html," Editor’s Note: AJ Willingham is senior culture writer for CNN.         “When you move again, you are going to go downstairs, and you are going to collect the clean clothes from the dryer.”           This is what I tell myself as I sit at my desk and stare out the window, paralyzed by the mounting weight of this simple task. It’s the end of the workday, and my 3:30 p.m. Adderall is coursing through my veins like blue lightning.           If I don’t try to move now, I could find myself staring vacantly at a computer screen for the next two hours. I don’t want that. I want to go downstairs and gather the laundry that’s sitting in the dryer, because laundry is one of those things that I, a functional person, should be able to do with basic fluency.           “And, while you’re there,” my brain adds, “you can get a trash bag.”           A trash bag, to bring to my home office where I work as a senior culture writer for CNN when I’m not at CNN’s Atlanta offices. I have an Emmy on one side of my desk, and on the other, a list of tasks that looks like it was written for a middle schooler: “Remember to check your email! You have a meeting at 1 p.m.!” (That second one is in huge letters, circled and underlined several times, like a silent scream.)           I’m proud of the career I’ve built over 15 years at CNN. I’ve written about taxidermy and cosplay, nonlethal police munitions and “rapture anxiety.” My work has won an Emmy, a National Association of Black Journalists Award and some Webbys, and gotten to explore innumerable fascinating facets of humanity. I used to think I had done it all in spite of my ADHD, which was officially diagnosed eight years ago. But what if, laundry notwithstanding, some of my success is because of it?           Throughout my career, I’ve had the honor of speaking to several college journalism classes. Sometimes I mention my lifelong struggle with attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, but I feel like it’s always a risk. Journalism is a discipline of details, a dance of deadlines. Admitting there’s something in my brain that makes those things difficult feels like calling my professional fitness into question.           But journalism is also an exercise in truth, isn’t it? While it would look more glamorous chattering in a newsroom or splashed across a web page, sometimes the truth is lying dormant in the dryer, waiting to be put away. Sometimes it’s hiding in a messy office between artifacts of a satisfying career and a mound of unfiled paperwork.           Cleaning the office is another task I wanted to accomplish today, or maybe have been wanting to accomplish for a week. It starts with the trash bag, which is downstairs, in the laundry room. One of the sad ironies for people who have ADHD is that we crave the order we can’t seem to create. Until the office is clean, I will always be a little distracted, surrounded by another task waiting to be done.           Unfortunately, with an errant thought, I have created a mega task, because remembering to retrieve two things from one location requires intense mental calculus that I, a person who can talk at length about at least a dozen irrelevant special interests, cannot access. (“It’s not hard!” chirps the blue rush of amphetamines, which are swirling around my brain but not quite reaching it yet.)           I won’t know until I start moving, which I haven’t. I stopped to write this all down. (That is a great writing tip for people with ADHD: Wait until you’re supposed to be doing something else, and the words will flow.)     READ MORE: If you have ADHD, here’s how to manage working from home   Mindfulness is another skill I rely upon so now I’m loosening my jaw, flicking glances at the green leaves outside in an attempt to calm my mind and return it to the task at hand, which is not collecting laundry or getting a trash bag but preparing to do those things. A common tip for people with ADHD is to break down a task into manageable bits: Stand up. Go downstairs. Open the dryer. Put the laundry in the laundry basket.           Oh, you forgot the laundry basket.           But first, step one: Think about the task. Then think about breaking it down (which is another task). Then recall you forgot a step in this imagined set of actions. Thank God you thought about it beforehand, or you would be in the laundry room right now without the laundry basket, looking stupid.           When asked about my experiences, I often describe ADHD as an ever-present animal. You can’t cage it or tame it into submission. You learn to live in kind cohabitation so you can do what you need to do, whether it’s crafting a personal essay on ADHD or putting away a load of laundry.           Sometimes, the former is easier than the latter. It’s certainly more important, which is why I’m writing this instead of shuffling downstairs repeating the phrase “Laundry and trash bag, laundry and trash bag” like a Druidic incantation.           If I were to start now, the whole laundry thing would take about five minutes, and I would be flabbergasted at how little effort it took, as if it were the first task I ever accomplished in my life and I now possess a secret never-before-considered solution, which is just doing it. Experts tell you to imagine how good it would feel to have the task accomplished. That approach is supposed to help start a task, but unfortunately it triggers another task: feeling guilty for not already accomplishing it in the time it took to inflate the simple act of laundry into a cosmic symbol for living. Feeling like maybe you’re not good enough for any of this, at all.           Just do it!           My parents, frustrated with all I could have done but didn’t as a child, had me write those words and hang them on my bedroom door. My mother cried once when I didn’t finish my homework in fourth grade. “Does she have a tumor?” she said to my father. “We should get her tested for a tumor.”           Turning to me in tears she asked, “Is it because you’re just not challenged?” I was smart, so I said yes. That wasn’t the real problem, but I didn’t have a name for the real problem. I wasn’t old or brave enough to tell her I had pleaded with myself more times than she ever could. That I was queasy with the premonition of a lifetime spent sensing other people’s disappointment.           It took years to get the right combination of support that helps me keep the beast asleep while I do my job. It’s a delicate balance of personal discipline, intentionality, open communication, prescription medicine and relentless, deranged positivity. The last ingredient seems so trite but is necessary for anyone struggling with a learning difference. I have learned that you have to be kind to yourself and embrace what you can do rather than wallow in guilt over what you think you can’t.           We often discuss the downsides of such differences instead of the very real strengths: An ADHD mind, agile and perpetually in motion, can make unexpected connections and present solutions no one else has considered. It is often brimming with compassion, creativity and curiosity. Editors who work with me can be frustrated when the guilt and anxiety I feel over fudging a deadline throws me off course. At the same time, they appreciate that I can easily adjust to feedback and new ideas with little elaboration.     READ MORE: Signs of ADHD can be different in girls         The stigma around ADHD and other learning differences is starting to crack as we discover more about what makes such brains tick. However, it’s still tough to talk about in high-demand professions such as journalism, where any divergence can feel like a liability for people like me.           After one talk I gave about working at CNN, a student hung back to tell me he was excited to hear someone in the business talk openly ADHD. I realized I should be talking openly about it, because, when properly managed, ADHD brings more to the story than you could imagine.           Now, instead of begging myself to “just do it,” I have a different note on my work laptop: “Do a good job.” That’s all I need most days. That, I can promise myself. I’ve written this story, so that’s one task off the list. When I finally do the laundry, I will do it so well.           It may not be today though.           I’m stuck with this brain for the rest of my life, so while I may do my best, sometimes, I’m trying to be happy with good. Journalism is about honesty, after all.    © 2023 Cable News Network.

health,FDA proposes ban on potentially harmful ingredient found in some sodas,https://edition.cnn.com/2023/11/02/health/brominated-vegetable-oil-ban-fda-proposal-wellness/index.html," Sign up for CNN’s Eat, But Better: Mediterranean Style. Our eight-part guide shows you a delicious expert-backed eating lifestyle that will boost your health for life.         The US Food and Drug Administration has proposed revoking its regulation authorizing the nationwide use of brominated vegetable oil, or BVO, as an additive in food.           The FDA’s decision comes after California banned the ingredient in October by passing the California Food Safety Act, the first state law in the United States to ban brominated vegetable oil. The additive is already banned in Europe and Japan.           “The agency concluded that the intended use of BVO in food is no longer considered safe after the results of studies conducted in collaboration with the National Institutes of Health … found the potential for adverse health effects in humans,” said James Jones, the FDA’s deputy commissioner for human foods, in a statement.     Counting time instead of calories also controls blood sugar and belly fat         Brominated vegetable oil — vegetable oil modified by bromine, a pungent, deep red oily chemical — is used as an emulsifier in citrus-flavored beverages to keep the flavoring from separating and floating to the top. Bromine is also commonly used in flame retardants.           It’s possible that dozens of products — mostly sodas — use brominated vegetable oil as an ingredient, according to the Eat Well Guide by the Environmental Working Group, a nonprofit research and advocacy group that focuses on consumer health, toxic chemicals and pollutants.           The low number of products containing this ingredient is due to past restrictions by the FDA.           “In 1970, the FDA determined BVO was no longer ‘Generally Recognized as Safe’ … and began overseeing its use under our food additive regulations,” Jones said in a statement. “Over the years many beverage makers reformulated their products to replace BVO with an alternative ingredient, and today, few beverages in the U.S. contain BVO.”     Foods that improve brain function and mood         Additionally, a 2012 petition with more than 200,000 signatures also brought attention to health concerns, according to an EWG news release. It also said many companies eliminated it from consumer products due to market pressure.           Brominated vegetable oil has been linked to health hazards including nervous system damage, headaches, skin and mucous membrane irritation, fatigue, and loss of muscle coordination and memory, according to the EWG. The ingredient can also accumulate in the body over time.           The studies motivating the FDA’s decision were conducted in animals, but the observed negative health effects were at levels closely approximating real-world human exposure, according to a news release. One harm some research found is toxic effects on the thyroid gland, which produces hormones critical for the regulation of blood pressure, heart rate, body temperature and metabolism.           “Today’s announcement will ensure everyone has access to products that don’t contain BVO,” Scott Faber, the EWG’s senior vice president for government affairs, said in a statement.     Eating red meat linked to higher risk of type 2 diabetes, study finds         Jones of the FDA said the proposed ban “is an example of how the agency monitors emerging evidence and, as needed, conducts scientific research to investigate safety related questions, and takes regulatory action when the science does not support the continued safe use of additives in foods.”           A final decision is yet to come — following reception of comments through January 17, 2024, and a review process — but if you want to avoid consuming brominated vegetable oil until then, check the ingredients lists of products before you buy them.     Correction: An earlier version of this story gave the incorrect count of the number of products on the market that contain BVO.  © 2023 Cable News Network. A Warner Bros. Discovery Company.

health,The significant health benefits of walking backward,https://edition.cnn.com/2023/11/03/health/retro-walking-backward-exercise-wellness/index.html," Editor’s note: Before beginning any new exercise program, consult your doctor. Stop immediately if you experience pain.         Head into any gym, and you may find someone walking backward on a treadmill or pedaling in reverse on an elliptical machine. While some may be employing reverse motion as part of a physical therapy regimen, others may be doing so to boost their physical fitness and overall health.           “I think it’s amazing to add in some backwards motion to your day,” said Grayson Wickham, a physical therapist at Lux Physical Therapy and Functional Medicine in New York City. “People are sitting way too much today, plus they lack varied movement.”           Quite a few studies have been done on the potential benefits of retro walking, a common term for walking backward. Participants who walked backward on a treadmill for 30 minutes at a time over four weeks increased their balance, walking pace and cardiopulmonary fitness, according to a March 2021 study.           In addition, a group of women decreased their body fat and boosted their cardiorespiratory fitness after a six-week program of backward running and walking, according to a clinical trial, the results of which were published in an April 2005 issue of the International Journal of Sports Medicine.           Other studies indicate backward motion may help those with knee osteoarthritis and chronic back pain, plus improve gait and balance.           Retro walking may even sharpen your mind and help you become more mindful, as your brain needs to be more alert when moving in this novel fashion. For this reason, plus the fact that backward motion helps with balance, older adults may especially benefit from incorporating some backward strolls into their routine, as one 2021 study of patients with chronic stroke indicates.           Why is backward motion so helpful? “When you’re propelling yourself forward, that’s a hamstring-dominant movement,” said Landry Estes, a certified strength and conditioning specialist in College Station, Texas. “If you’re walking backwards, it’s a role reversal, where your quads are firing and you’re doing knee extensions.”     As few as 4,000 steps a day can reduce your risk of death, but more is better         As a result, you’re working different muscles, which is always beneficial, plus gaining strength. “Strength overcomes a lot of deficiencies,” Estes said.           You’re also moving your body in an atypical way. Most people spend their days living and moving in the sagittal plane (forward and backward motion), and almost exclusively in the forward sagittal plane, Wickham said.           “The body adapts to the positions and movements and postures you do most often,” Wickham said. “That can lead to tight muscles and joints, which leads to joint compensation, which leads to joint wear and tear, then pain and injury. The more we can add in varied movement into our day-to-day activities or in the gym, it’s so much more beneficial for the body.”           Retro movement is hardly a new idea. People in China have been walking backward for centuries for physical and mental health. Moving backward is also common in sports — think soccer players and referees.     Rucking is an easy way to fitness         There are even some backward running and walking races, plus people moving in reverse while competing in famous events such as the Boston Marathon. Loren Zitomersky did so in 2018 to raise money for epilepsy research and try to break a world record. (He achieved the former but not the latter.)           It’s pretty easy to get started. The key, as with any new exercise, is to take it slowly. You could begin by walking backward for five minutes several times a week, Wickham said. Or take a 20-minute stroll, with five of those minutes moving in reverse. As your body gets used to the motion, you can bump up the time and pace or try more challenging moves, such as walking backward in a squat.           “If you’re younger and exercise regularly, you can probably walk backwards for as long as you’d like,” Wickham said. “It’s relatively safe, per se.”     Sign up for CNN’s Fitness, But Better newsletter series. Our seven-part guide will help you ease into a healthy routine, backed by experts.           Walking backward while pulling a sled is one of the exercises that Estes favors. But he said it’s also great to walk backward on a self-powered treadmill if you can find one. While motorized treadmills are also an option, it’s more beneficial to be working under your own power, Estes said.           Retro walking outside is another option, and one Wickham recommends. “While the treadmill simulates walking, it’s not as natural. Plus, you have the potential to fall. If you fall outside, it’s less dangerous.”           If you opt for retro walking on a treadmill, especially a motorized one, start off by holding the handrails and setting the speed fairly slow. As you become accustomed to the movement, you can walk faster, increase the incline and let go of the handrails.     ‘Cozy cardio’ is a kinder, gentler way to start getting fit         If you elect to try it outside, first choose a spot that’s free of hazards, such as a grassy patch in a park. Then begin your retro adventure, keeping your head and chest upright while rolling from your big toe to your heel.           While you may need occasionally to peer over your shoulder, you don’t want to be constantly doing so, as that contorts your body. Another option is to walk with a friend who is moving forward and can serve as your eyes. After a few minutes, switch roles so your friend can reap the benefits, too.           “It’s so great to get in varied movements,” Wickham said. “And one of those is doing things backwards.”     Melanie Radzicki McManus is a freelance writer who specializes in hiking, travel and fitness.  © 2023 Cable News Network.

health,What are the symptoms of bipolar disorder?,https://edition.cnn.com/2023/11/02/health/bipolar-disorder-explained-wellness/index.html,"       It used to be called manic depression in an effort to capture the swing of emotions from intense manic highs to the lowest of lows. Today it’s called bipolar disorder, another way to describe a mental illness that has two completely different presentations.     Artificially sweetened ultraprocessed foods linked to depression in women, study finds         Comedian Taylor Tomlinson, host of the new CBS late-night show, “After Midnight,” launching in early 2024, is open about her diagnosis of bipolar disorder in an Netflix special.           “Being bipolar is like not knowing how to swim. It might be embarrassing to tell people, and it might be hard to take you certain places,” Tomlinson said in her 2022 Netflix special, “Taylor Tomlinson: Look at You.” “But they have arm floaties. (Audience laughs.) And if you just take your arm floaties, you can go wherever the hell you want.”           Tomlinson is one of an estimated 40 million to 50 million people worldwide who may have bipolar disorder, according to Mount Sinai Hospital in New York City. “It typically begins in young adulthood, often takes a chronic course, and carries an increased risk of suicide, making it a major public health concern and cause of global disability,” the hospital said.           Making diagnosis and treatment more difficult — a person with bipolar disorder may go months or even years without symptoms, or may cycle through both extremes in rapid sequence, according to the National Alliance on Mental Illness. The mood swings from high to low and back again can affect a person’s behavior, judgment, energy, sleep and the ability to think clearly, experts say.           When a person with bipolar disorder is “up,” they are often euphoric — intensely happy, excited and full of energy — but unusual irritability can also be part of the swing, according to the Mayo Clinic.     Is exercise or medication better for depression? Experts weigh in         A person can be manic or hypomanic, which is a less extreme form of mania, but both have the same symptoms. The person may be wired, jumpy or abnormally upbeat and confident, often with an exaggerated sense of well-being. There can be increased energy or agitation, along with distractibility, racing thoughts and little need for sleep. The person may be extremely talkative or go on spending sprees, make ill-advised investments and take sexual risks, all signs of poor decision-making.           The more extreme form of mania can cause highly noticeable problems at work, school and at home and in social situations, according to Mayo. In some cases, people in a manic phase can break from reality — hearing voices, becoming paranoid and psychotic — and require hospitalization.           The polar opposite of the manic side of bipolar disorder are the periods of depression, often severe or “major” depression that can cause significant problems at work, school, home and in relationships.           To be diagnosed with major depression, a person must have several of the following signs:           Feeling empty, hopeless, sad and tearful, along with a loss of interest or pleasure in nearly all activities are key symptoms. Sleep can be affected — a person can have insomnia or sleep too much.           Fatigue and loss of energy is another, along with either restlessness or a slowing of behavior. Fluctuating weight is another — either significant weight gain or loss, or an increase or decrease in appetite.           Indecisiveness or a decrease in concentration and thinking skills, along with feelings of worthlessness or inappropriate guilt are more signs, as are thoughts or attempts of suicide.           There are several types of bipolar disorder, which differ by how symptoms present, according to the Mayo Clinic.     What are intrusive thoughts? Experts weigh in on a commonly misunderstood mental health term   Bipolar I: People with bipolar I disorder have had at least one manic episode along with a period of major depression or less severe mania. People with bipolar I can also have an episode of psychosis in which they have a break from reality that may require hospitalization.     Bipolar II: People with bipolar II have never had a manic episode. Instead, they have had at least one major depressive episode and at least one hypomanic episode.     Cyclothymic bipolar disorder: In this form of the disease, a person cycles through many periods of less severe hypomanic episodes and periods of depressive symptoms that do not meet the criteria for major depression.           Bipolar disorder may also be caused by drugs, alcohol or medical conditions such as multiple sclerosis or stroke, Mayo noted.           Depending on symptoms and severity, bipolar treatment has a number of treatments, some of which may be used simultaneously.     Millions have used the 988 mental health crisis line, but most say they wouldn’t turn to it again         Antipsychotic medications and mood stabilizers are often prescribed, according to the National Alliance on Mental Illness. Cognitive behavior therapy and family therapy are other avenues of treatment, as are self-management techniques. Exercise, meditation, faith and prayer “can support, but not replace, treatment,” NAMI said.           A long-term study called the Systematic Treatment Enhancement Program for Bipolar Disorder has found that people “taking medications to treat bipolar disorder are more likely to get well faster and stay well if they receive intensive psychotherapy.”           A 2021 study by the Psychiatric Genomics Consortium, an international consortium of scientists dedicated to studying the genetic basis of psychiatric disorders, found 64 DNA variations that increase risk of bipolar disorder.           Those generic variations overlapped with other mental health conditions, the study found. For example, researchers found that bipolar I disorder is genetically similar with schizophrenia, while bipolar II disorder shares more genetic similarity to major depression.    © 2023 Cable News Network.

health,Matthew Perry went to rehab 15 times before getting sober. Here’s why it’s so hard,https://edition.cnn.com/2023/11/02/health/staying-sober-matthew-perry-wellness/index.html,"       It took 15 entries into rehab before the late actor Matthew Perry found long-term sobriety, he wrote in his memoir, “Friends, Lovers and the Big Terrible Thing.” And after his death, loved ones and fans alike are honoring his commitment to recovery.           “I’ve had a lot of ups and downs in my life and a lot of wonderful accolades,” Perry told The Hollywood Reporter in 2015. “But the best thing about me is that if an alcoholic comes up to me and says, ‘Will you help me stop drinking?’ I will say, ‘Yes. I know how to do that.’”           Having spent years advocating for people with substance use disorder, why did it take so long for him — and so many others in the public eye — to reach a point of sustained sobriety?     What are intrusive thoughts? Experts weigh in on a commonly misunderstood mental health term         While admitting there is a problem and getting into treatment such as a rehabilitation center is an important first step, it isn’t the end of the journey as movies and TV shows often portray, said Dr. Danielle Dick, director of the Rutgers Addiction Research Center in Piscataway, New Jersey.           In fact, much of what the general public thinks about addiction doesn’t fully capture the difficulty and complexity of the experience, said psychologist Dr. John F. Kelly, Harvard Medical School professor of psychiatry and director of the Massachusetts General Hospital Recovery Research Institute.           “Nobody ever plans on becoming addicted,” he said. “Yes, people make a decision to use alcohol and use other drugs. But no one ever says, ‘I want to be addicted to a drug.’”           More than 140,000 people die from excessive alcohol use in the United States each year, and another more than 106,000 die from drug overdoses, according to the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.           To understand why the problem is so widespread, people must recognize the complexities around not just getting sober — but staying sober, Kelly said.           First, it is important to know where addiction originates.           It is not a choice someone made. Addiction is “a biomedical condition, and it is a condition that you need sustained treatment for,” Dick said.           Many factors contribute to the development of the chronic disease, Kelly said.           “Some people right out of the gate have a genetic predisposition, where their family has history of an alcohol or other drug addiction,” he said.           Those predispositions can combine with a history of trauma or developmental experiences to make someone much more likely to develop an addiction, Kelly added.           When thinking about addiction, people need to remember that because of genetic factors and how different bodies react, the feeling of craving a drink may be entirely different for someone with substance use disorder than it is for you, Dick said.           “The thing that everyone in the public still seems to think about is getting into rehab or getting their loved one into rehab,” Dick said. “That is just like one teeny, teeny piece of the addiction treatment landscape.”     Foods that improve brain function and mood         Entering treatment is not a cure for addiction, and it is certainly not a guarantee, Kelly added. About 25% to 40% of people with substance use disorders don’t maintain sobriety long term and go into remission — which is defined as a year or more of sustained abstinence from use, Kelly said. Those who sought some form of treatment were more likely to have success in recovery, according to a July 2020 study authored by researchers at the CDC and the National Institute on Drug Abuse.           “It takes a continuous vigilance and effort to be able to maintain the gains made,” Kelly said.           “It’s a bit analogous to kind of like physical fitness,” he added. “You can’t go to the gym for a year and then stop going and expect to be fit in the next year.”           Like other physical illnesses, even when there are great improvements, it is crucial to maintain health to reduce the risk of recurrence, Kelly said.           Part of that path to health is finding ways other than substance use to respond to other mental health concerns, Dick said.           For some people, mental illnesses such as depression or anxiety occur alongside but independent of their addiction, Kelly said. And for some, their addictions help to alleviate those concerns.     If you or someone you know is struggling with mental health, help is available.

On average, it can take a person eight years of trying to get sober before they reach their first year without their drug of choice, Kelly said.           That process of recovery and relapse is not a sign of failure — it’s part of the process, Dick said.     The loneliness epidemic: Nearly 1 in 4 adults feel lonely, new survey finds         “It does not mean that this individual is never going to be able to achieve recovery,” Dick said. “Think of it as a key part of the learning process. ‘OK, so what happened, and how do we do better?’”           Sometimes, the relapse can indicate a need for changes in socialization, environment or stress levels to reduce the urge to use, Dick said.           For others living with addiction, it’s a process of working on the biological side, she said.           “The devious nature of drugs means that when an individual has been using heavily, it also changes their brain and that makes it harder to maintain recovery,” Dick said. “It creates these cravings because you’ve literally changed the receptors in your brain, your brain wiring.”           The natural rewards we get in life, such as affection from a loved one or an accomplishment at work, are no longer as powerful or reliable compared with the reward our brains feel with drugs or alcohol, she added.           “It takes a while to kind of retrain the brain,” Dick said.           “Despite common views that (alcohol use disorder) is an inevitably worsening disorder, most people with AUD can and do recover, and their individual paths to recovery vary widely,” said Dr. Nancy Diazgranados, deputy clinical director of the National Institute on Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism.           There may be a lot of things working against sobriety, but the prognosis is generally good, Kelly said.           A majority of people living with addiction will reach remission — somewhere between 60% and 75%, he added.           “It can take many years, and a lot of bumps in the road of recovery, to be able to achieve that,” Kelly said.           And although relapses and restarts may be discouraging, they are often still a sign of progress, he added. Often the periods of sobriety between relapses get longer.     How to stop using alcohol as a confidence crutch         First an addict may get three months of sobriety and then relapse, but the next period without using may then be six months, Kelly said.           “Drinking patterns in the first year of recovery often include one to several short periods or a few longer periods of heavy drinking,” Diazgranados said. “With time, drinking episodes tend to become less frequent.”           It is important to remember that there are good treatment centers — inpatient and outpatient — and long-term support programs to help people get sober, he said.           “We should not give up, and I don’t think Matt would want people to give up hope,” Kelly said.    © 2023 Cable News Network.

health,"Sweet spot for HRT may reduce dementia risk by nearly a third, study says",https://edition.cnn.com/2023/11/02/health/hormone-replacement-dementia-wellness/index.html," Get inspired by a weekly roundup on living well, made simple. Sign up for CNN’s Life, But Better newsletter for information and tools designed to improve your well-being.         Hormone replacement therapy may protect the female brain from Alzheimer’s disease and dementia — if hormones are taken in the 40s and 50s when menopausal symptoms begin, according to a recent meta-analysis.     FDA greenlights a new type of drug for menopausal hot flashes         The degree of protection appears to differ by hormone type, the report found.           The average age of menopause onset — defined as when a woman hasn’t had a period for 12 months in a row — is 51, although women can naturally enter this phase between the ages of 40 and 58, according to The Menopause Society. Symptoms such as hot flashes, night sweats, sleep and libido disturbances, heart palpitations, and vaginal pain can occur for years in advance, in what is called perimenopause.           “There’s a window of opportunity,” said lead study author Dr. Lisa Mosconi, director of the Alzheimer’s Prevention Program and the Women’s Brain Initiative at Weill Cornell Medicine in New York City. “Hormones work best for the brain when taken in midlife in presence of menopausal symptoms to support women through the menopause condition.”           In fact, the brain has a higher chance of being protected if hormone replacement is started soon after menopausal symptoms begin, according to the analysis recently published in the journal Frontiers in Aging Neuroscience.           Length of time also matters: As long as a woman began hormones while she was in menopause, there was a 26% reduced risk of dementia if hormones were taken for more than 10 years.           However, if a woman began estrogen-progesterone therapy after the age of 65 or more than 10 years after the start of menopause, dementia risk rose, said Mosconi, a neuroscientist who is also certified in holistic health care.     Menopause symptoms: How to prepare for effects on your brain         “While there is not a clear one-size-fits-all approach, in the right woman, at the right dose, and for the right duration of time, I believe that hormone replacement therapy can be one of our most powerful tools to reduce a woman’s risk for cognitive decline and to slow down Alzheimer’s pathology,” said Dr. Richard Isaacson, director of research at the Institute for Neurodegenerative Diseases in Florida. He was not involved in the study.           “I believe this may be especially true for women with one or more copies of the APOE4 genetic variant, which is present in about 25% of people,” Isaacson said via email. “It’s essential for neurologists and primary care physicians to work closely with gynecologists … and monitor treatment outcomes over time.”           There is more to the story, according to current science. Just how harmful or helpful hormone replacement therapy may be also depends on the type of hormones that are prescribed, especially at older ages.           Estrogen-only hormone therapy can be prescribed if the uterus has been removed via hysterectomy. If the uterus is intact, however, a woman should use a combination of estrogen and progesterone or risk the possibility of uterine cancer.           For women in their 40s, 50s and early 60s, both types of hormones protected brain health, Mosconi said: “If you look at the data in midlife, both estrogen-only and estrogen-progesterone therapy are brain protective, which is the good news.”     Oral estrogen-only use riskier than patch or vaginal cream for menopausal women, study says         In fact, people using estrogen-only therapy in midlife had a 32% lower risk of dementia, while using estrogen and progesterone provided a 23% risk reduction when compared with using no hormone therapy, the analysis found.           Estrogen protects the brain in several ways, according to science. The hormone is a “master regulator” in the brain, playing a key role in glucose uptake. Estrogen regulates cellular power plants that provide the body energy required for metabolism. The hormone also supports plasticity in the brain, allowing it to rewire, reorganize and make new connections.           “Estrogen is involved in a gazillion different things,” Mosconi said. “It pushes your neurons and brain cells to work harder, faster and better; it supports the synthesis of neurotransmitters like serotonin, which is key for mood, sleep and appetite; and it’s just as important for the immune system, including immunity inside the brain. It’s an anti-inflammatory hormone that doubles as an antioxidant.”           There is good news for older women as well, but only if they don’t have a uterus and are using estrogen-only hormonal therapy, Mosconi said.           “If you start taking hormones after age 65 or more than 10 years after the final menstrual period, then estrogen-only therapy doesn’t have any effects. The overall effect is neutral,” she said.     Hot flashes are more dangerous than previously thought, so prepare now         However, there is up to a 30% increased risk of dementia for women starting estrogen-progestogen therapy after age 65 or more than 10 years after the final menstrual period. Just how significant that risk may be, Mosconi said, is not yet entirely clear.           “It was borderline significant,” Mosconi said. “Studies are quite mixed: There’s a lot of evidence for protective effects and then for negative effects, but on average, the data seem to point to an increased risk of dementia.”           Why? It is possible progesterone has an “antagonizing effect” that may change or blunt the neuroprotective properties of estrogen, the study said. Or it’s possible emerging signs of dementia in the older brain, such as amyloid plaques and tau tangles, may influence the risk. More research is needed.           “What I find interesting is that all of the studies we examined that found a negative association with the use of estrogen plus progesterone, the women were on a synthetic form of progesterone,” Mosconi said.           There are two ways to replace progesterone. One way is by taking bioidentical micronized progesterone, which has a molecular structure identical to what is made in the ovaries. The other is to take a synthetic form of progesterone called progestin, which is similar to hormones made in the ovary but “not the same thing,” Mosconi said.     PMS now could mean double the risk of early menopause later, study shows         “There is some evidence that bioidentical progesterone is safer, and that synthetic progestins are what’s driving the increased risk,” she said. “However, we need more studies on that.”           Many doctors today prescribe bioidentical estrogen and bioidentical progesterone that can be delivered via transdermal patches on the skin, which Mosconi says is a safer route of administration.           “If you take hormones through the skin, the effect is a little bit gentler, because the hormones don’t have to be processed by the liver,” Mosconi explained. “If you take something by mouth, those hormones need to be processed through the liver and that can increase the risk of some cardiovascular issues.”           There is good news on the horizon for older women, Mosconi said. Scientists are developing a new generation of hormone replacement called selective estrogen receptor modulator, or SERM.           “These preparations are specifically engineered to target one organ — the brain. It’s kind of genius because you really want an estrogen that goes straight to your brain and does not impact your reproductive organs and raise the risk of cancer,” she said.           There will be no need to take a SERM estrogen with a progesterone, Mosconi said.           “Estrogen stimulates cell growth, which is linked with an increased risk of uterine cancer,” she said. “But if you have an estrogen that doesn’t even go to your uterus, then you don’t need the progesterone.”           Until science delivers on its promise, women should discuss their hormonal symptoms with an expert in menopause, experts say. Every woman is different, and what may be best for one’s brain health may not be an optimal solution for another.           In addition, some women are not candidates for hormone replacement therapy, perhaps due to family history, heart conditions or clotting disorders. For those women, there are vetted nonhormonal options to consider.    © 2023 Cable News Network. A Warner Bros. Discovery Company. All Rights Reserved.  CNN Sans ™ & © 2016 Cable News Network."
health,Yuki Iwamura/AFP/Getty Images,https://edition.cnn.com/2023/11/06/health/cdc-wastewater-surveillance-major-us-airports/index.html,"       The US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention is expanding its infectious disease surveillance program at four major US airports to more than 30 pathogens, including flu, RSV and other respiratory viruses.           The Traveler-based Genomic Surveillance program, led by CDC’s Travelers’ Health Branch, was introduced during the Covid-19 pandemic to detect new SARS-CoV-2 variants and other pathogens through nasal swab and wastewater sample collection from arriving international travelers at US airports.     Health misinformation and lack of confidence in vaccines continue to grow, years after the Covid-19 pandemic, survey shows         “We have known that travelers are a very important population to consider for tracking new and emerging infections,” Dr. Cindy Friedman, who leads the CDC’s traveler genomic surveillance program and is the chief of the agency’s Travelers’ Health Branch, told CNN.           The program currently operates Covid-19 surveillance at seven major international airports in the United States. For a pilot program, it’s now expanding to test for more than 30 bacteria, antimicrobial resistance targets and viruses including influenza A and B, and respiratory syncytial virus, known as RSV, at Boston Logan International Airport, San Francisco International Airport, Dulles International Airport in Washington, D.C., and John F. Kennedy International Airport in New York.           The traveler surveillance program was introduced in 2021 when the CDC began collecting nasal swab samples from anonymous international travelers arriving at participating airports who volunteer to get swabbed.           “We started this as a concept. Could we get travelers to volunteer at the airport to give us a sample voluntarily when they came in from countries all over the globe?” Friedman said. “And could we get enough samples to then test and do genomic sequencing and know very quickly what was coming into our country.”     Demand outstrips supply for some doses of new shot that protects babies against RSV         As of last month, the surveillance program has tested over 370,000 travelers through nasal swab sampling, with around 6,000 travelers volunteering weekly. The program has collected samples from travelers from more than 135 countries and has sequenced more than 14,000 samples for further analysis.           The wastewater program, which was introduced in August 2022, collects wastewater from a single plane using a custom-made collection device. Samples are then shipped to a laboratory for RT-PCR testing. If samples come back positive for a specific pathogen, such as Covid-19, they undergo whole genome sequencing to determine variants.           “One sample from an aircraft coming from a geographic destination afar can give us information potentially about 200 to 300 people that were on that plane,” according to Friedman.           Since the program’s inception, the agency has worked alongside Ginkgo Bioworks, a biotech company focused on building a global biosecurity infrastructure to empower governments, communities, and public health leaders to prevent, detect, and respond to a wide variety of biological threats.           Matthew McKnight, the general manager of biosecurity at Ginkgo Bioworks, adds that surveillance programs such as TGS are created in part to help prevent another health crisis, like the Covid-19 pandemic, from happening.     Mysterious Covid-19 lineages in US sewers could offer clues to chronic infections         “The dream is that you’re running similar programs across the world in many, many places, so you get much earlier detection than if somebody shows up at a hospital of something emerging,” McKnight said. “The idea would be, how do you prevent a pandemic? You catch something really early, which allows you to put it into a vaccine manufacturing process much faster. Today we don’t have as much of that early warning as we want. And these are the first stages of it.”           Through wastewater testing and nasal swabbing, Friedman said, TGS has detected many Covid-19 variants entering the United States up to six weeks before they were officially reported nationwide, including Omicron BA.2, BA.3, XBB and BA.2.86. Now, she said, the program is focused on monitoring emerging respiratory viruses as cold and flu season ramps up.           Currently, the rate of Covid-19 hospitalizations remains steady with just over 15,700 hospital admissions per 100,000 people recorded for the week ending on October 28, according to CDC data. The number of Covid-19-related deaths also hasn’t seen a significant change in the last week, with just under 600 deaths reported.

Flu season is ticking up slightly throughout the country, but activity remains low, CDC data shows. For the week ending October 28, 189 cases of influenza were reported by public health laboratories, with 77% of cases being influenza A, and 23% being influenza B.           “We are interested in these fall respiratory pathogens,” Friedman said. “We want to able to sequence them, so we know the genomics of the strain.”           Friedman also highlights the importance of knowing whether strains of virus are changing and identifying what countries they are coming from.           “There are a lot of blind spots globally where there’s limited testing and monitoring,” she said. “In general, our focus is on airports that are international hubs, and have flights coming in from a broad array of international locations.”     CNN’s Deidre McPhillips contributed to this report.  © 2023 Cable News Network.

style,inVerse Films,https://edition.cnn.com/2023/11/08/style/shakespeare-portrait-space-folio-celebration-intl-scli-scn/index.html,"       William Shakespeare’s influence over the world remains unwavering more than four centuries after the renowned dramatist began his career.           To mark the continued resonance of the famed playwright’s words 400 years after the publication of his “First Folio” on November 8, 1623, British filmmaker Jack Jewers has sent a portrait of Shakespeare along with a speech from one of his best-known works to the edge of space.           Around 1,000 copies of the folio, originally published as “Mr. William Shakespeares Comedies, Histories & Tragedies,” were printed seven years after his death. The volume of more than 900 pages included a collection of 36 plays. Without it, 18 plays, including “Macbeth,” would have been lost, according to Reuters.           Attached to a weather balloon, with a camera and GPS tracker, the portrait, accompanied by a speech from “A Midsummer Night’s Dream,” was taken to Earth’s upper atmosphere, according to a press release from inVerse Films. A team from aerospace company Sent Into Space helped with the space flight.           The scene was filmed for the short film “Lovers and Madmen,” in which a young woman enters an art contest by attempting to send a portrait of Shakespeare into the air.           It is narrated by English actor Tom Baker, who played the fourth Doctor in “Doctor Who.” He performs Shakespeare’s “More strange than true” speech from “A Midsummer Night’s Dream” to accompany visuals of the Earth’s horizon leading into outer space, according to the release.           The film is a part of a series of six shorts from filmmaker Jack Jewers, who has reimagined six of Shakespeare’s most popular speeches and poems for the 21st century to celebrate this monumental anniversary.     ‘A masterpiece rediscovered’: Unseen Monet painting expected to fetch more than $65 million at auction         “I had this image in my head: a portrait of Shakespeare – the universal playwright, whose work I truly believe speaks to everyone – backgrounded by space, with earth’s curvature in the background. What more fitting way to celebrate the universality of our human experience, and how it has been captured for 400 years by these wonderful words, than that?” said Jewers in the release.           As well as space travel, the films explore the relevance of Shakespeare’s words to us in 2023, the impact of the Covid-19 pandemic, Russia’s war in Ukraine, immigration and the refugee crisis in Europe, according to inVerse Films.           “Our Revels Now Are Ended,” which takes from Shakespeare’s “The Tempest,” looks at the loneliness and social isolation during the pandemic, and the feelings of liberation and reuniting with loved ones after lockdowns ended.           “Everything that has been happening to us in the past few years of upheaval – mass disease, concerns about immigration, protest, conflict in Europe, a growing desire to challenge authority and speak truth to power – was also happening in 1623 when the First Folio was published,” said Jewers.           “The parallels are uncanny and Shakespeare’s words are fresher now than ever before in their ability to speak powerfully to our own contemporary lives,” he added.

A video posted to Just Stop Oil’s account on X shows the activists wearing white Just Stop Oil t-shirts and breaking the glass protecting Diego Velázquez’s 17th-century “Rokeby Venus” with orange safety hammers.           The painting is known for having been previously damaged in an act of protest by suffragette Mary Raleigh Richardson in 1914.     Are Just Stop Oil’s dramatic art museum protests hurting their own cause?         The National Gallery said on X that the room was cleared of visitors and police were called after the demonstration took place just before 11 a.m. local time on Monday.           “The painting is now being removed from display so it can be examined by conservators,” the post added.           The Metropolitan Police tweeted: “Two Just Stop Oil activists have been arrested for criminal damage. The glass protecting a painting at the National Gallery has been vandalized.”           A number of Just Stop Oil activists also gathered in Whitehall, the London thoroughfare that runs from Trafalgar Square to the Houses of Parliament, on Monday. The protest group said more than 100 people were marching in the area before the police began to arrest them.     Climate activists sentenced to prison for Vermeer protest         “Within 15 minutes we have arrested at least 40 activists who were slow marching,” the Met posted to X. “Whitehall is now clear. We will provide updates on arrest figures in due course.”           Just Stop Oil has targeted several artworks in recent years, including Vincent van Gogh’s “Sunflowers,” a copy of Leonardo da Vinci’s “The Last Supper,” and Johannes Vermeer’s “Girl with a Pearl Earring.”           The activist group has also disrupted several major sporting events in England this year, including golf’s Open Championship, Wimbledon, the Ashes cricket test series and the World Snooker Championship, as well as a performance of the musical “Les Misérables.”    © 2023 Cable News Network.

style,Diver’s huge discovery of ancient coins off coast of Italy hints at hidden shipwreck,https://edition.cnn.com/2023/11/06/style/diver-ancient-coins-sardinia-scn-intl-scli/index.html,"       More than 30,000 large bronze coins dating back to the fourth century AD have been found by a member of the public during a dive off the coast of Sardinia, Italy—a discovery that could point to the presence of a shipwreck, according to the Italian culture ministry.           The diver spotted some “metal remains” in shallow water near the town of Arzachena, the ministry said in a statement Saturday. These turned out to be “follis”—Roman bronze or copper coins also later used as Byzantine currency.           Based on their weight, the total number of coins in the find is estimated to be between 30,000 and 50,000, the ministry said. This is more than the 22,888 follis hoard found in Seaton, United Kingdom in 2013, it added.           All the coins retrieved are in a “rare state of preservation,” with only four damaged yet still legible. According to the statement, the coins date from 324 to 340 CE and were produced by mints across the Roman empire.          “(The finding) highlights the richness and importance of the archaeological heritage that our seabed, traversed by men and goods since the earliest times, still guards and preserves,” Luigi La Rocca, director general of archaeology, fine arts and landscape for the region, said in the statement.           The culture ministry said the location where the coins were found—a sandy clearing between the beach and an area of seagrass—could, theoretically, preserve a shipwreck. Also found were walls of African- and eastern-produced amphorae—tall, narrow-necked Roman or Greek jugs with two handles.           “The treasure found in the waters of Arzachena represents one of the most important discoveries of numismatic finds in recent years,” La Rocca said, adding that the region has an “extraordinary heritage,” but that it is “also a very fragile one, constantly threatened by natural phenomena and human action.”       CNN’s Sharon Braithwaite contributed to this reporting.  © 2023 Cable News Network.

style,Pranab Joshi/Courtesy Itumbaha,https://edition.cnn.com/style/nepal-itumbaha-monastery-treasures-repatriation-rubin-museum/index.html,"       Hidden under years of dirt and grime in storage rooms, hundreds of precious religious objects have been rediscovered at a monastery in Nepal’s capital, Kathmandu. Gilded crowns worn by Buddhist priests, halos that once adorned statues of deities and mini stupas gifted by the local community are among the long-lost antiques now on display at Itumbaha, one of the city’s oldest “viharas,” an early form of a Buddhist monastery.           The story of the objects’ rediscovery stretches far beyond the warren of shrines, courtyards and ornately decorated columns that have stood on the site since the 11th century. Until earlier this year, two of the sculptures were more than 7,500 miles away in New York’s Rubin Museum of Art, which specializes in Himalayan art, and the Metropolitan Museum of Art.           Like many of Nepal’s religious sites, Itumbaha is no stranger to the theft and looting of its relics and architecture. Nepalese authorities estimate that up to 80% of the country’s religious artifacts have been stolen and sold on the black market since the 1980s. As museums digitize their collections and make them publicly available online, more claims are being made around the world for pillaged objects to be returned.           Amid growing calls for Western museums to repatriate stolen cultural heritage, the Met announced in 2022 that it was returning a 13th-century wooden temple carving of a “salabhinka,” a semi-divine spirit, to Itumbaha. Earlier that year, the Rubin repatriated two Nepalese wooden carvings — one originating from the monastery, and the other from a nearby temple complex — that its researchers believe to have been looted.           But for Itumbaha’s leaders, the process of recovering these objects was not only about addressing historical injustice. It sparked a dialogue that brought to fruition a long-time dream: a new museum, in the monastery grounds, to research and catalog its more than 500 artifacts. Opened in late July, it currently displays some 150 of the works, spanning six centuries, and tells the history of antiquities looting in Nepal. The rest of the objects remain in storage.           It has long been known that Itumbaha harbored priceless artifacts, but locating and inventorying them was never a priority for the cash-strapped monastery. When the World Monument Fund, a private non-profit dedicated to preserving cultural heritage, began reconstruction work on the site almost two decades ago, members of the vihara came across many objects “buried in layers of dust and dirt and mud and sand,” said Swosti Rajbhandari Kayastha, a museologist and Lumbini Buddhist University lecturer who was tasked with putting together the museum.     Controversial art dealer’s daughter will return over 100 antiquities to Cambodia         Some of the items on display were already known about — like a gold crown worn by the vihara’s founder, Keshchandra, and a ceremonial golden door through which a goddess is said to have passed a sacred sword to Nepali kings at their coronations, providing them with the strength to rule. But others, like the aforementioned crowns, halos and stupas, were surprise finds, as the bulk of objects languished in storerooms covered in thick layers of dust, all but forgotten.           Records are crucial to protecting and preserving cultural heritage. Without documentation and photographs placing them on site, the looted items found in US museums may never have been returned to Itumbaha. So, after completing its own research, the Rubin offered funding and expertise — at the monastic leaders’ request — to help the vihara establish its own museum.           “It is our hope that through this collaboration we can create further awareness around the cultural importance of historic collections held in religious institutions like our own and the need to document and protect them,” said Pragya Ratna Shakya, president of the Ithum Conservation Society, which takes care of the vihara, in a statement announcing its partnership with the Rubin.     Cleveland museum sues to block seizure of $20M headless statue         In a phone interview with CNN, executive director of the Rubin Museum, Jorrit Britschgi, said: “It’s so important to prevent future thefts to be able to say: ‘Hey listen, this was in the house collection as of (this) date.’” The Rubin is currently doubling down on efforts to identify other items in its collection with questionable provenance, he added.           Roshan Mishra, a founding member of the not-for-profit organization Nepal Heritage Recovery Campaign (NHRC), said many relics were looted and removed from Nepal after the country began welcoming overseas visitors (Nepal was a hermetic kingdom, closed to foreigners, until the fall of the Rana dynasty in 1951) and the global art market began valuing its elaborate carvings and statues.           “In the ‘60s and ‘70s, Nepal was just open. Nobody was even thinking… that (representations of) gods and goddesses would be stolen one day,” said Mishra. “(They were just) part of the culture, part of the community; they were almost like trees, bushes, animals and us.”           In the decades that followed, heritage protection took a backseat amid political upheaval and a protracted civil war. But now, with the return of relative stability since the war’s end in 2006, Nepalis are taking a closer look at what items went missing.           Organizations like the NHRC have been at the forefront of efforts to identify objects taken from religious sites across the country. The non-profit has helped identify (often based on photos and tips posted to an anonymously run Facebook page, Lost Arts of Nepal) dozens of objects it believes belong to the country, a number of which have now been recovered.           For the NHRC, repatriating objects is not just about rebuilding Nepal’s collections — it’s returning the gods to the people and restoring rituals that were once part of everyday life. Many ceremonies and festivals centered around certain relics stopped when they were stolen, putting an end to age-old traditions, Mishra said.           There’s an element of urgency for the group now, as many of the missing objects were taken several decades ago. “It is very likely that the next generation of people would easily forget the rituals,” said Mishra.           In this spirit, Itumbaha’s new museum hopes to show how religious artifacts can be presented as living heritage. As a community space where religious rites and rituals take place every day, it’s an “open” museum in which historical objects are sometimes used by the vihara’s members. Bells are rung in ceremonies, for example, while at a festival in August relics were taken out into the courtyards, where locals were allowed to touch and examine them. It’s a departure from most of the world’s museums, where valuable objects are placed in temperature- and humidity-controlled glass cases under high security.     Prix Pictet photography contest winner captures the beauty and harshness of life in rural Rajasthan         While this may lead to wear and tear, or even the eventual destruction of precious objects, the museum’s approach reflects the idea that artifacts are part of life — and can even have lives of their own. “We need to allow these objects to live and die with dignity,” Mishra said. “Within the monastery space, or a temple space, they’re constantly touched, right? You pray, you do the ritual around them… you don’t need to think about conservation and preservation when they perform a living tradition.”           “It’s entirely up to that community what they want to do with these objects, and most of the time they’re (put) back into the temple and shrines, and they will be worshipped,” he added.           The artifact returned by the Met and the Rubin have now been restored to their original spots and are once again part of Itumbaha’s architecture.           The project brought together people from across generations to decipher what some of the rediscovered items were used for, according to Kayastha. It unearthed memories and revived interest in the history and traditions of Itumbaha and its Newar Buddhist devotees — something that had previously proven a challenge, she added.           “For many of the objects, even the community has lost their knowledge (of their functions),” Kayastha said. “They had to make four or five different calls to different people to ask: ‘What is this thing called? What was it used for?’”           The museum, she said, will always be a work in progress — an open research center to share knowledge and revive lost knowledge. “Nothing is final, nothing is the whole truth, there’s more to be appended over time,” she said.           Not everyone was happy with the Rubin’s role in financing the project. Nepali heritage activists protested the Itumbaha museum’s opening in July, accusing the Rubin of using the collaboration to launder its public image and deflect calls to scrutinize the provenance of other items in its collection.           They held placards reading: “Say No to Cultural Invasion,” “Rubin Stop Your Whitewashing” and “Rubin Give Our Gods Back.”           In an open letter to the Rubin’s director, NHRC chairperson Riddhi Baba Pradhan welcomed the collaboration, but warned that the exhibition “cannot be a way to generate misplaced goodwill nor to divert attention from the responsibility of foreign collectors and museums on the matter of stolen heritage items from Kathmandu Valley and Nepal as a whole.”           Pradhan also called on the Rubin to help quash the market for stolen cultural objects, which she said “requires committed curators to investigate, report and repatriate.”           Fellow NHRC member Roshan Mishra meanwhile suggested that Western museums commission local artisans in Nepal, and elsewhere, to create authentic replicas that could be displayed in place of looted objects. Doing so would “clean” their collections while supporting living artists and cultures, he added. He also called for more museums to set up processes to identify and repatriate objects.           “We don’t have to name and shame institutions (with potentially stolen items in their collections) on social media,” said Mishra, adding: “We can have a conversation… we can figure out how to make these things happen.”       Correction: An earlier version of this story used an incomplete form of Pragya Ratna Shakya’s name.Clarification: This article was updated to clarify details of the Rubin Museum of Art’s repatriation process.  © 2023 Cable News Network.

style,Secretive power plant in Taiwan opens to  public for the first time — as an art space,https://edition.cnn.com/style/taiwan-beigan-power-plant-matsu-biennial-hnk-intl/index.html,"       In a sleepy Taiwanese island village just eight miles off the coast of mainland China, scooters whiz past an unassuming building that has stood here, largely overlooked, for decades.           As far as residents of Beigan — part of the outlying archipelago of Matsu — are concerned, the structure houses the entrance to a decommissioned Cold War-era thermal power plant dug deep into a mountain. But with the site designated a restricted area by Taiwan’s military, few had ever seen inside of the secretive facility.           That was until late September, however, when the plant was opened to the public for the first time since it was commissioned nearly 50 years ago, as part of the Matsu Biennial. Transforming the facility into a futuristic cyberpunk art space, the installation aims to shine a light on Matsu’s history as a military outpost on the frontline of a war that never came — or at least, one that hasn’t come yet.           Known locally as Jun Hun (or “Army Soul”), a nickname shared with the Taiwanese army division that built it, the Beigan Power Plant entered service in 1975 and became a linchpin of the local economy before closing in 2010. “It changed the residents’ lives on the island forever,” read a recent article by the state-run Matsu Daily.           When the nationalist Kuomintang (KMT) forces retreated to Taiwan in 1949, following defeat to Mao Zedong’s insurgent communists in the Chinese Civil War, it retained control of Kinmen and Matsu — archipelagos lying hundreds of miles from Taiwan’s capital, Taipei, but just across from the shores of mainland China. Shadows of war have hung over the islands for decades; between the 1950s and 1979, the Chinese People’s Liberation Army sporadically bombarded them with artillery shells.     Dance that comforted Taiwan during its loneliest hour returns to the stage         To protect their new power plant from shelling, the KMT dug deep into Matsu’s craggy mountains and built it in a concealed military tunnel — allowing the facility to not only generate electricity but also to serve as an air-raid shelter for residents.With a thaw in cross-strait relations at the turn of the century, the plant was decommissioned and has stood as a Cold War relic ever since.           The transformed Beigan Power Plant is the flagship venue of the Matsu Biennial, which runs through November 12 and features artworks exploring the outlying islands’ heritage, cultural identity and military past. To enter the installation, visitors are ushered into a narrow tunnel equipped with industrial lamps that emanate a warm glow.           Upon reaching a control room overlooking the engine room, they are met by somber red lights marking the perimeter of the space. Orange lights projected onto the power generators themselves accentuate the rusty metal of the machinery.           The lighting designers behind the art installation, Annie Chu and Liu Ping-yi, told CNN in a joint interview that the lamps’ arrangement and low-temperature colors were designed to evoke the feeling that the power plant is still in operation.           “The power plant is the heart of Matsu that hasn’t stopped beating, and the generators are the essence of the power plant,” Liu said told CNN at the studio he shares with Chu.           Amid ongoing hostility from across the strait, Matsu and Kinmen were both under military rule for more than three decades until 1992, many years after martial law was lifted in the rest of Taiwan. Various aspects of people’s everyday lives were regulated, with curfews in place and movements tightly restricted. Residents were even prohibited from owning basketballs or turning on lights at night, in case they attracted enemy attention.     How Taiwan’s new $220 million arts center radically rethinks theater design         “We want to use lighting to bring viewers back in time,” Liu added. “We want them to think about how tense the atmosphere was and how scarce resources were in Matsu.”           This visual experience is complemented by a soundtrack combining the deafening rumbling of power generators with the buzzing of electrical currents and piano music, an audio experience created by sound artist and composer Wang Yu-jun.           “I want to use sound to breathe new life into the deserted power plant, so that viewers can grasp what it was like when these generators were still running,” Wang told CNN at her studio.           By simulating the deafening sound of a power plant, the installation also intends to pay tribute to the employees who worked there, some of whom suffered hearing damage due to their prolonged exposure to high noise levels, according to Wang.           Beijing has long claimed Taiwan as its own territory and, despite having never controlled the island, has not ruled out taking it by force. In recent years, it has increased economic, military and diplomatic pressure against the island democracy of 24 million, sending fighter jets almost daily into Taiwan’s air defense identification zone.           In a recent spike, China sent more than 100 warplanes close to Taiwan in a 24-hour span in September, prompting the island’s defense ministry to urge Beijing to cease its “persistent military harassment.”           Yet, despite Matsu’s frontline role in ratcheting cross-strait tensions, the artists behind the Beigan Power Plant installation insisted that politics did not influence their work, which is simply about “revisiting” the area’s past.           “We hope viewers will reflect on Matsu’s memories,” Chu said.

style,"Nelson Mandela, the family man: New book offers an intimate portrait of the South African leader",https://edition.cnn.com/nelson-mandela-new-photographs-rizzoli-book-spc-intl/index.html,"       The story of Nelson Mandela’s life is well told. Whether through his autobiography “Long Walk To Freedom,” presidential memoir “Dare Not Linger,” numerous biographies, miles of newsprint, documentaries and feature films, the late president of South Africa is no mystery to the public. Yet a new book penned by his daughter aims to take a fresh perspective on the man behind the statesman.           Published by maker of luxury tomes Rizzoli, “Mandela: In Honor of an Extraordinary Life” is a photographic account of the man and his family. Authored by Dr. Pumla Makaziwe Mandela, the youngest and last surviving child of Nelson and first wife Evelyn Mase, it gives an intimate view of a man on a mission to deliver a new dawn for the nation, and the family that grew along that journey.           Featuring a tribute from the Reverend Al Sharpton and passages from Dr. Mandela, the book also contains never-before-seen images of the private life of Mandela and his children, released for the first time nearly 10 years since his death in December 2013 at the age of 95 in Johannesburg, South Africa.           In an email to CNN, Dr. Mandela said she wrote the book “so that people have a better understanding of who he was (and) what formed him as a human being. He had a certain moral code that he adhered to that he learnt from his ancestors, and he was consistent in following that until he closed his eyes.”           The book is, she said, both a tribute to her father and for her own grandchildren, “so that (they) can have a living reference of who their great grandfather was and be inspired by his courage and love for humanity.”           Dr. Mandela’s account is divided into chapters looking at her father as the boy who grew up in the village of Qunu in the Eastern Cape, then as an activist, prisoner, politician and family man, as well as detailing his legacy. Some may be familiar – the conditions of his jail on Robben Island – others not, like the time a young Mandela fled to Johannesburg to escape a prospective marriage, stealing and selling a cow to pay for his travel.           Despite her lifelong relationship, the author said the writing process provided the opportunity to learn more about the man she affectionately calls “Tata” (father in Xhosa). “I understood my father a bit better in terms of the sacrifices that he made,” Dr. Mandela said.           “He made choices and some of those choices were not easy,” she continued. “When he grew up and went to university, he thought that would help him to assist his mother and sisters and get them out of poverty. He had regrets about the fact that he was not able to do that from a family perspective, but then again, he was successful in a larger sense because he helped achieve emancipation for his countrymen.           “Change is not easy and takes a lot of courage, determination and consistency. He realized that bringing about a new dispensation in South Africa would take all of us as a collective and bring the entire country along.”           Ahead of the book’s publication, CNN asked Dr. Mandela to share her thoughts and memories on a selection of family photographs being made public for the first time.

style,Ben Birchall/PA/AP,https://edition.cnn.com/style/david-shrigley-pulped-fiction-tan/index.html,"   Editor’s Note: This article was originally published by The Art Newspaper, an editorial partner of CNN Style.   (CNN) — It all began in 2017, when a charity-owned thrift store in Swansea, Wales, put a notice in its window imploring people to stop donating copies of Dan Brown’s “The Da Vinci Code.” On average, the shop was receiving one copy per day. The plea went viral, catching the eye of the British artist David Shrigley, who decided to try and collect as many copies as he could, amassing 6,000 books over six years.           The brainwave to pulp them and turn them into copies of George Orwell’s “Nineteen Eighty-Four” came when Shrigley re-read the dystopian novel during the pandemic — 2020 marked 70 years since Orwell died, meaning the book was out of copyright and could be published by anyone.           Over the weekend, copies of Shrigley’s limited-edition version of Orwell’s classic went on show in the thrift store that inspired the project, which he dubbed “Pulped Fiction.” Displayed in rows from ceiling to floor, the black-and-white covers have a dizzying effect. “It’s like you’ve entered a totalitarian regime where there is no choice. This is the book, and you’re going to read it,” Shrigley quipped in an interview.     In new pandemic novel, ‘Station Eleven’ author explores how the apocalypse is always now         The artist first read “Nineteen Eighty-Four” when he was an art student in the 1980s. On reading it again, he said he realized “that it was still a really resonant book, (and) that it seemed even more relevant than when I first read it when you were invited to see it as a parable of Soviet or Chinese communism.”           In today’s climate, Shrigley sees the “subversion of language” in the book as more revealing of contemporary society, particularly when it comes to the words employed around war. “Ethnic cleansing is now the name for what used to be called genocide,” he said. “Russia’s invasion of Ukraine wasn’t a conflict; it was war. Conversely, it’s not a culture war. It wasn’t a war between Betamax and VHS, and it wasn’t a war between Blur and Oasis. Those were arguments.”           Shrigley cited how the writer Margaret Atwood, when her 1985 novel “The Handmaid’s Tale” was made into a TV series in 2017, said there wasn’t anything in the book that hadn’t already happened in the United States. “From the removal of women’s rights to the removal of civil rights from the general population. These weren’t invented phenomena. They were things that were actually happening at the time,” Shrigley said.           The artist thinks the same could be said of “Nineteen Eighty-Four.” “War is presented as peace. Enemies are invented for us. We’re invited to think that black is white, and white is black. Day is night, and night is day,” he said. “This is a book that people should read. It’s still really relevant.”           Though his project is not intended as a piece of library criticism, Shrigley describes “The Da Vinci Code” as “a holiday book about a fairly benign conspiracy — unless you happen to be a Christian and are quite offended by it, which is fair enough.”           Does he think Brown would approve of his project? “He’s a difficult man to get hold of,” Shrigley said. “We’ve heard from his publicist, and there’s been nothing negative. There’s been no cease-and-desist.” (Brown’s representatives did not respond to CNN’s request for comment.)     Rare compound detected in the ‘Mona Lisa’ reveals a new secret, study says         A collaborative effort between Shrigley, his studio team and others, including the graphic designer Fraser Muggeridge, “Pulped Fiction” is arguably Shrigley’s most conceptual work to date. (In a bizarre twist, Muggeridge’s grandfather, the journalist and broadcaster Malcolm Muggeridge, proofread the original novel for Orwell.)           Costing “well into six figures,” the project has been self-funded, and Shrigley said he may not make his money back — not that he cares. In Swansea, the newly printed books are selling for £495 ($600) for the first 250 customers, while the remaining thousand will be sold for £795 ($963) on Shrigley’s website.           “I’m in a position in my life now where I can actually afford to take risks and do things that I want to do, even though they don’t necessarily really fit in my canon of work,” Shrigley said. “The really interesting thing about a work like this is that the conversation informs the work. It’s the conversations that you have which further its progress.”     Read more stories from The Art Newspaper here.  © 2023 Cable News Network. A Warner Bros. Discovery Company.

style,‘A masterpiece rediscovered’: Unseen Monet painting expected to fetch more than $65 million at auction,https://edition.cnn.com/2023/10/30/style/claude-monet-painting-auction-intl-scli/index.html,"       A previously unseen painting by Claude Monet is expected to fetch more than $65 million when it goes on sale in New York early next month, according to a statement released by Christie’s auction house.           Entitled “Le bassin aux nymphéas” or “Water lily pond,” the two-meter- (6.6-foot-) wide painting forms part of Monet’s famous “Water Lilies” series, depicting light dappling across the water, casting reflections of water lilies and willow trees.           Painted around 1917-1919, it dates from the latter period of Monet’s life, as he produced a series of works depicting water lilies that now hang in museums worldwide.           And after almost a lifetime of studying color and light, this painting “captures the dynamism and beauty of nature’s transience, exploring the ephemeral atmosphere, seasonal blooms, watery depths, and glimmering reflections of light,” Christie’s statement said.     Scientists confirm long held theory about what inspired Monet         Until now, the painting had remained in the same family collection for more than 50 years, “impeccably preserved and hidden away,” Max Carter, Christie’s Vice Chairman of 20th and 21st Century Art, said in a statement.           “With Monet, seemingly everything has already been seen or said,” Carter added. “Le bassin aux nymphéas, which has never been exhibited or offered at auction, is, however, that rarest thing: A masterpiece rediscovered.”           The painting will be offered in Christie’s evening sale of 20th-century works on November 9.           As a leader of the Impressionist movement, Monet exerted a significant impact on the art world, influencing his contemporaries such as Vincent van Gogh as well as later Abstract Expressionist painters such as Jackson Pollock.           His paintings are now emblematic of Impressionism itself, shedding the early critical ambivalence toward them to become some of the most recognizable pieces of art worldwide.           Significant Monet paintings have previously fetched eye-watering sums of money at auction. Another in the “Water Lilies” series sold for $84.7 million at Christie’s in May 2018, while a painting from the “Haystacks” series sold for $110.7 million at Sotheby’s a year later.    © 2023 Cable News Network.

style,Egypt’s pyramids host stunning works of art,https://edition.cnn.com/style/egypts-pyramids-host-breathtaking-new-art-exhibit/index.html,"       On the plateau overlooking the ancient Pyramids of Giza in Egypt, a major outdoor art exhibition brings together the work of 14 international contemporary artists who have created site-specific installations responding to the iconic monuments. In one project, a new pyramid structure emerges in wicker; in another, glass sculptures appear to make the ancient pyramids float on water.           “Forever Is Now III” (on until 18 November) is the third edition of an annual exhibition held at the site, and the biggest yet. Organized by Nadine Abdel Ghaffar, the founder and curator of Cairo-based arts firm Art D’Égypte, the event aims to celebrate ancient Egyptian culture through contemporary creativity.           “Every year we have an amazing group of artists that are in dialogue with this civilization,” said Ghaffar over video call from Cairo. Art D’Égypte works with UNESCO to ensure the exhibition leaves the 4500-year-old world heritage site completely unharmed. (A 50cm layer of imported sand is used to place the artworks on, so they don’t even touch the ground.) The works this year engage with the fertile territory of concepts presented by the pyramids, from mythology and spirituality to technical innovation and architecture.     A grape soda fountain, a moonbounce and an electric fan: Is this modern art?         Mexico City-based Argentinian artist Pilar Zeta has created “Mirror Gate”, a limestone portal decorated with gold and iridescent blue spheres and topped by a pyramidal apex, under which lies a checkerboard pathway leading to a mirrored egg on a plinth. “I’ve always been fascinated by the Pyramids of Giza and the entire ancient Egyptian culture — the mysticism around it, the enigmas,” Zeta said. “The pyramids are the most sacred sculptures on planet Earth in my opinion.”           Zeta’s installation, which appears like a surrealist painting and postmodernist film set in one, is rich in layered meaning. The portal represents connections across time, the iridescent blue references the scarab beetle that symbolizes rebirth and regeneration, and the mirrored egg represents the cosmic egg in Egyptian mythology that denotes creation. The artist’s use of materials aims to blend the ancient and modern, with natural limestone reflecting the pyramids’ construction, and painted metal nodding to “our post-industrial society”.           A symbolic use of material was also important for Dutch artist-designer Sabine Marcelis, who adopted glass for her sculpture “RA”, a sundial structure named after the ancient Egyptian sun god. “Egypt being the birthplace of both the sundial and glass as material, I wanted to pay homage to those incredible inventions,” Marcelis explained over email. “Even the pyramids themselves were a form of sundial.”           While the tall rectilinear sculpture casts moving shadows across the sand during the day, at night a special technology embedded within the glass transforms the installation into a source of light. “There are solar cells sandwiched between the glass which harness the power of the sun to charge a battery inside the artwork,” said Marcelis. “This means that the artwork can exist as a completely off-grid installation and powers its own lighting at night.”     The Afrobeats star on a mission to raise the profile of African art         Glass also plays a key role in “Horizon” by Greek sculptor Costas Varotsos, a series of metal circles half-filled with glass and arranged in a line. By making it appear as if the pyramids are sitting on water, the work emphasizes the relationship between the monuments and the Nile river on the horizon behind.           “Translucent Pyramid” by Saudi artist Rashed Al-Shashai, adds a new, 6m-tall pyramid to the plateau. Constructed out of wicker crates, the work references the traditional craft of wicker weaving in Egypt and advocates sustainable and heritage-based practices for contemporary design.           Another architectural installation, “The Ghost Temple”, has been designed by Egyptian-born British sculptor Sam Shendi. Created from geometric steel forms in red, the work imagines the remnants of an ancient temple. It appears as a portal to walk through, and celebrates the art of architecture and geometry that made the pyramids possible.           “Treasures”, a steel sculpture by Emirati jewelry artist Azza Al Qubaisi, also invites visitors to walk through it. Its rippling and undulating form takes inspiration from the patterns of the surrounding desert landscape, leading to a central pyramid structure, topped by a golden apex.           Rashid Al Khalifa, an artist and member of the Bahraini royal family, has created “Reality is Timeless”, a series of copper and brass structures emerging from the ground at varying angles. Conceived as seemingly archaeological fragments of a labyrinth, each one is decorated with perforated motifs taken from historic diagrams of the ancient Egyptian labyrinth.           Meanwhile, “Inside Out Giza” by French photographer JR continues a project he started in the 2022 edition of Forever is Now. Having previously installed a photo booth on site for visitors to have their picture taken, JR this year showcases a selection of those large-scale portraits in black and white, laid out on the plateau in front of the pyramids.           Reflecting on the exhibition, Ghaffar, the curator, explained that she sees the ancient pyramid complex as “a token of hope to humanity.” It has “withstood so many things,” she said — from wars to pandemics — “and it’s still there, and still has secrets, so there’s hope.” That hope, she added, has to be shared with everyone – and this unique art exhibition aims to do just that.    © 2023 Cable News Network.
